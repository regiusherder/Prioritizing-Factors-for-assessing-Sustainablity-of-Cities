"Explainable energy consumption and speed prediction in sustainable cities using deep learning","2025","10.1007/s00521-024-10850-7","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-86000428187&doi=10.1007%2fs00521-024-10850-7&partnerID=40&md5=b676289e0dc1cd861059eac58c463963","The idea of sustainable cities has drawn a lot of attention due to the quick expansion of metropolitan areas as well as the growing problems brought on by resource scarcity and climate change. Cities that prioritize sustainable practices are those that minimize their negative effects on the environment, maximize resource efficiency, and improve the standard of living for their citizens. Therefore, for sustainable cities, this paper uses the vehicle energy dataset (VED) to estimate travel times and calculate vehicle energy consumption. The dataset contains 12,609,170 road elevation tracks, 12,203,044 speed limit tracks, and 12,281,719 speed limit records with direction. An open-source routing engine called Valhalla is utilized to do a variety of tasks, including finding paths, matching maps, and creating maneuvers based on paths. The three primary stages of the suggested model are data pre-processing, feature extraction, and result interpretation. In the data pre-processing stage, null values are first eliminated and data normalization is implemented. Then, three techniques known as the gated recurrent unit (GRU), recurrent neural network (RNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) are used to optimize the model. Finally, the results are interpreted through the use of SHAP (SHapley Additive explanations) in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques. The LSTM model yields the best prediction results, achieving 15.2662 RMSE, 11.7266 MAE, and 0.6696 R2 at 8 batch size, according to the evaluation results. Additional experiments are carried out in batch sizes of 8, 16, 32, and 64.The lowest metrics are produced by batch sizes of 64, while the best metrics are produced by batch sizes of 8. © The Author(s) 2025."
"Examining Ecology–Agriculture–Economy Nexus Shifts to Propose Win–Win–Win Pathways for Sustainable Development in Mountainous Areas: Insights From the Greenest City in China","2025","10.1002/ldr.5462","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105001061244&doi=10.1002%2fldr.5462&partnerID=40&md5=0f171e515ccd21528778680c82cd5657","Ecosystem restoration projects (ERPs) are effective methods for reversing land degradation. However, the dynamic responses of the ecology–agriculture–economy nexus to ERPs and socioeconomic development have yet to be systematically analyzed. To address this issue, we adopted an ERP hotspot as a basis for exploring the evolution regimes of sectoral variables and their determinants. ERPs facilitated vegetation restoration and strengthened carbon sequestration and soil retention, whereas grain productivity declined sharply since 2000 because of industrial and planting structure adjustments. Economic growth was accompanied by marked industrial transformation; the dominant role of the primary industry was gradually replaced by that of other industries, with the population and employment structures changing accordingly. Rural population loss weakened the agricultural production capacity, with the promotion of economic crops further degrading the dominant role of grain crops. Such nexus shifts indicated that positive progress in the ecological and economic sectors should be further optimized to reserve sufficient space for agricultural production and industrial development, instead of relying solely on expanding afforestation areas. Notably, the temporary synergic co-evolution of nexus sectors from 2008 to 2022 is not stable because of the low grain self-sufficiency ratio, which might threaten the sustainability of social-ecological systems. Therefore, agricultural production efficiency must be improved through large-scale production and improvements in agricultural production conditions to sustain the grain supply. The nexus perspective enriches our understanding of interlinkages among sectors in different phases, facilitating the formulation of coordinated strategies for regional sustainable development. © 2025 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
"A Combined Multi-Criteria Decision-Making and Social Cost–Benefit Analysis Approach for Evaluating Sustainable City Logistics Initiatives","2025","10.3390/su17030884","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85217748484&doi=10.3390%2fsu17030884&partnerID=40&md5=3ded2c6f5d756ce764a4843a6f5f5c76","Decision making in city logistics (CL) is complex due to the numerous concepts and alternatives, as well as the intricate relationships between measures and effects. This study introduces a novel approach to evaluating urban freight transport (UFT) by combining multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) and social cost–benefit analysis (SCBA). This combination aims to improve decision making for sustainable CL concepts, particularly in reducing externalities in last-mile delivery. The model assesses various CL initiatives and urban consolidation center (UCC) concepts for their impact on UFT externalities. It uses the MCDM for ex ante scenarios assessment and prioritization. Input data were collected through a survey of experts from various sectors, and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was applied in the case study of Novi Sad, Serbia. The prioritization highlighted the significance of implementing restrictive regulatory measures, alternative transport modes, and operational optimization within UCC concepts. By estimating capital, operational, and external costs, SCBA was applied to the prioritized UCC concepts, which were then further evaluated using the SCBA outputs. Sensitivity analysis was employed to assess the robustness of the proposed model. This paper offers valuable insights into the potential use of existing tools within a hybrid model to enhance decision making in CL. © 2025 by the authors."

By examining factors influencing purchase decisions, such as cost considerations, environmental concerns and perceptions of vehicle performance, researchers can elucidate patterns of consumer acceptance and identify barriers to widespread adoption. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) and stimulus organism response (S-O-R). The current research aims to bridge the gap by focusing on consumers' intention to buy ethanol-blended fuel. Data were collected from 303 survey respondents and analysed using partial least square structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). Findings: The study finds that adopting motivation, policy incentives, risk perception and sustainable practices significantly influence the intention to purchase ethanol-blended fuel. Surprisingly, cost perception and infrastructure readiness do not have a significant impact on purchase intention. Social implications: The study proposes four innovative policy implications to amplify the adoption of ethanol-blended fuel. These policies are (a) flexible fuel vehicle incentive schemes, (b) renewable fuel mandate and certification, (c) ethanol pricing and infrastructure development policy and (d) ethanol urban mobility and public transportation initiatives. Originality/value: This study provides novel insights into the factors influencing ethanol-blended fuel adoption in India, contributing to the literature on sustainable transportation solutions. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited."

According to UN Habitat, we are rapidly approaching the time when five billion people will live in cities, and by 2050 this could be 7.5 billion, with much of the growth concentrated in the global south. The context for this paper is how urban growth is linked to notions of community values which cross-link to concepts of heritage. Urban places are where the majority of the world’s population lives and will increasingly do so. Inextricably linked to this proposition is that urban places are where community memories, identity and sense of place are inherent, and here is the link with heritage. What do these paces mean to us? Are there regional, national and international differences? Parallel with these ideas of urban heritage is the sense of place and attachment people have for green spaces in cities and the incremental loss of green spaces. This prompts the question of how this phenomenon has stimulated scholarly and professional attention on the concept of greening cities. Underpinning the inquiry is an understanding of how urban green growth has become regarded as critical to the well-being of people in urban areas. Central to such concerns is the role of people and their social and cultural values which shape how they see their cities. Notable also is how there has been growing concern for urban conservation since the 1990s and the need to understand cities as people spaces, not just collections of buildings. Discourse on cities as spaces for people has its roots in, and builds on, a paradigm shift in innovative thinking and concepts in the twentieth century which has continued into the twenty-first century. Mindful of this background, the paper opens with a review of the historical background to these concerns on the premise that the past is not always a foreign country2. It then moves into consideration of heritage values and the role of landscape and what we mean by values. This consideration is central to the paper and moves into an overview of the Historic Urban Landscape (HUL) approach as new approaches and tools for urban conservation came into play. © 2025 by the author."

This review explores the diverse tools and techniques employed for microclimate assessment, highlighting their strengths and limitations in promoting sustainable cities and environments. This review aims to provide an overview of the various tools and techniques used in microclimate assessment, focusing on their applicability, limitations, and potential for enhancing sustainability in cities. A synopsis of urban microclimate studies post-2010 is included. For the purpose of this review, a total of around 400 academic journals were considered, out of which 137 of the most recent and relevant publications were specifically emphasized and highlighted. It is observed that the number of high-resolution simulation studies focused on microclimates has surged tenfold since 2010. Despite advancements, prevailing approaches to urban microclimates face ongoing challenges elucidated in the literature. The paper proposes several future research directions aimed at enhancing urban planning and design. These include prioritizing Large Eddy Simulation (LES)-based studies for more reliable insights into localized climate patterns, developing hybrid models that combine physics-based and data-driven approaches, integrating detailed remote sensing products into existing urban microclimate models, understanding the impact of air pollution on microclimate conditions, examining rural microclimates, and creating user-friendly tools for city planning. These proposed research directions can significantly advance urban planning and design by fostering innovative approaches to microclimate assessment. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd"

Their significant contributions have also garnered attention in academic literature. However, only a limited number of studies have investigated the integration of the SDGs into the visions and strategies of municipalities, as well as the factors driving their efforts toward the SDGs. Therefore, this study aims to fill this important gap by examining, under the lens of stakeholder theory, the SDG performance of Italian municipalities and the drivers of these performance levels. The results reveal a delay in the progress toward achieving the SDGs. Furthermore, they demonstrate a negative impact of population size on the SDG performance of Italian municipalities, alongside positive effects of multiculturalism, location in the northern regions, and the level of tourism. The results significantly contribute to academic literature and hold important practical implications. © 2024 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
"Quantifying urban heat island using multiple data sources for planning a sustainable city in an arid climatic zone","2025","10.1007/s10668-023-04162-4","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-86000427495&doi=10.1007%2fs10668-023-04162-4&partnerID=40&md5=9686e4b3b1cbf2ea137deec361787941","The effects of urbanization on cities have been well documented around the world. The term ""urban heat island"" (UHI) refers to one of several consequences of urbanization. The intensity of UHI is quantified in Muscat and its neighbouring sub-cities during 2019–2020. These sub-cities have seen a rapid increase in inhabitants over the last decade ranging between 15.1 and 107.4%. Land surface and air temperature were measured to quantify UHI under different land use types. The study found that all the selected sub-cities have shown variations in UHI influenced by land surface temperature, which ranged from 0.24 to 6.74 °C. In general, the measured land surface temperature indicated maximum UHI values in both winters (UHI = 6.74 °C) and summer (UHI = 5.07 °C) seasons. While measured air temperature shows the formation of UHI in the winter season in all sub-cities with a maximum value of 4.65 °C. In contrast, in summer it occurs only in two sub-cities with values of 0.65 °C and 4.17 °C at the night. Analyzing meteorological and remotely sensed data emphasizes findings from field measurements with the formation of UHI in all sub-cities in winter with values ranging between 0.43 and 5.37 °C, meanwhile, its absence in most sub-cities during the summer. There are significant differences (P < 0.05) among the land use types with the lowest mean value in greenery space (21.70 ± 0.59 °C). The mean land surface temperature with respect to land cover type follow the pattern of road > pavement > bare soil > vegetation except for the daytime in summer, clearly demonstrates the influence of vegetation in reducing UHI effect. This was also verified by the evidence that the air temperature above the vegetation cover were reduced by 1.3 to 2.1 °C and 2.6 to 3.1 °C during day and nighttime respectively. Additionally, there was a moderate correlation between land surface and air temperature in the winter (R2 = 0.58) compared to the summer (R2 = 0.29). Quantification of UHI is important for city planners to ensure sustainable urbanization and take into account land use and land cover changes in the future to build resilient cities. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023."

To achieve sustainable cities, sustainable practices must be integrated into physical infrastructure and digital realms, including social media, which has become an essential aspect of modern communication. This study aims to examine how artificial intelligence-driven social media influences policymakers' decisions and actions to develop sustainable cities, in alignment with SDG 11. The methodology involves mapping SDG narratives to develop a reliable and efficient model to enhance sustainability during implementation. In addition, a questionnaire was administered to reach a wider audience with the SDGs, and the results were analysed. Mixed methods approaches, combining qualitative and quantitative data analysis, examine the relationship between social media and sustainable city development has been adopted. Policies can leverage social media effectively to advocate sustainable urban development, thus enhancing their outreach and impact. In addition to these concerns, social media has been associated with accuracy and reliability, and echo chambers have reinforced existing biases. Only 3.8% of respondents believe social media platforms do not use AI. In comparison, surveys show that 38.5% believe they only use it to a limited extent, compared to 57.7% who believe it is extensively used. While social media still faces challenges, it remains a powerful tool for fostering dialogue, promoting sustainability, and mobilizing support. To address the associated challenges, social media platforms must be used responsibly and ethically, in alignment with sustainable development principles. © School of Engineering, Taylor’s University."

Moreover, using spatial analysis is necessary to assess the effectiveness of the conceptual design depending on different specifications. Even though these concepts are closely related, they have been done separately. To overcome these limits, in this paper, a decision tool is created using the Grasshopper for Rhinoceros 3D software as a core component of a flexible system to generate the urban structure and optimize land use. The tool includes several processes for analyzing urban distribution using spatial analysis, such as accessibility and visibility. The approach was systematically applied and evaluated in a simulated environment using BenGuerir's Green City as a case study. Therefore, it established an efficient infrastructure network facilitating seamless pedestrian movement. It also allows the creation of diverse building types in key locations to suit people's requirements based on urban planning rules to sustainably conserve the area by balancing resources, activities, and people in space. © 2024 The Authors"

To this end, urban street eco-systems should be characterised, organised and utilised effectively. But is this happening on a mass scale across the globe? Are our urban street classification schemes forward-thinking and ready to respond to the emerging sustainability and resilience challenges cities face nowadays? This paper aims to answer these questions by examining and decoding the prevailing “formal street classification scheme model” through conducting a detailed worldwide review of formal national street classification plans. Out of 196 countries investigated, 128 official street classification plans were identified, analysed and evaluated. We also used an Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) with 20 experts coming from different fields (i.e., academics, policymakers, practitioners) to enhance our results and contribute to developing an index evaluating urban street classification under the prism of sustainability. The outcomes of our work signify that conventional pro-automobile approaches still prevail, thus shaping car-centric conditions, which undermine the role of sustainable modes and reduce the ability of cities to innovate and succeed. It is demonstrated that the road to achieve sustainability and completeness in urban transport systems, considering these car-led plans, is still uphill. Based on that, multi-dimensional classification systems prioritising public and active transport, while appreciating street's urban aspect should be promoted in the future. © 2024 The Authors"

However, the conventional transportation mechanism highly consumes fossil energy and heavily deteriorate the environment. Fossil fuel vehicles pose several challenges for Pakistan, affecting energy security, economic stability, and environmental health. Dependence on obsolete and inefficient vehicles results in increased fuel consumption and import expenditures, burdening the national economy. Therefore, electric vehicles (EVs) are promoted as a realistic, environmentally friendly technology that can transform a sustainable transportation system. Furthermore, a critical gap exists in evaluating the key barriers to adopting EVs through technological transformation. Hence, this investigation intends to implement the multi-criteria decision-making approach to assess the challenges in the adoption of EVs aligned with sustainable development goals (SDG-11 & SDG-13). The research strategy begins with a comprehensive examination of existing literature and consultations with specialists to identify potential hindrances. Thus, a novel Spherical Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchical Process was employed to prioritize the main and sub-barriers. This study evaluated the four key obstacles related to EVs in emerging economies like Pakistan. The expert's evaluation indicated that the infrastructure barrier (34.99 %) ranked first, the financial barrier (27.92 %) was prioritized second, and technology was the third main barrier (20.99 %). Furthermore, public infrastructure, the effect on the electricity grid, and the lack of maintenance workshops are the top three sub-barriers. Hence, the government of Pakistan needs urgent action to enhance the technological and financial capability for the implementation of EVs. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd"

However, unregulated urbanization increases the vulnerability of these trees to invasive pests, leading to tree loss and a reduction in ecosystem benefits. While many studies focus on forest ecosystems, limited research exists on the impact of pests and disease in urban settings. This review aims to address this gap by examining the ecosystem services provided by urban trees and the threats posed by pests and pathogens on them. It highlights the negative implications of pests on urban trees, affecting ecological, economic, and cultural factors such as disrupting biodiversity, reducing ecosystem services, increasing management costs, lowering property values, degrading aesthetics and heritage value, and risking human health. It discusses several strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of pests and pathogens and control their spread. Additionally, it characterizes the various stages to detect and manage tree pests (pre-border, border, or post-border) and identifies critical areas for further improvements within each stage before their establishment. The study also highlights strategies like biological control and implementing well-designed landscapes (with high diversity street trees), which can effectively control the spread and mitigate the pests after their establishment.

This study aims to investigate potential LUCs in Chattogram District, Bangladesh, by employing the analytic hierarchy process and fuzzy logic, considering living, agricultural, and ecological criteria to promote sustainable urban growth. Results reveal that nearly a quarter of the district’s land is highly suitable for agricultural and ecological purposes, while only 4.68% is highly suitable for living use. The fuzzy logic analysis uncovers significant conflicts between agricultural and ecological land use, affecting 14.57% of the area, while conflicts involving all three land uses are comparatively minor, impacting 1.99% of the land. However, moderate conflict intensity is observed across a substantial portion of the district. The high area under the curve values (0.807–0.972) validate the model’s accuracy. Hotspot analysis identifies 69 unions, covering approximately 855.78 km2, as high-conflict zones. These findings illustrate that LUCs are indeed a barrier to sustainable city development in Chattogram. Addressing these conflicts is key to promoting sustainable city development in rapidly urbanizing regions like Chattogram.

Such technology enables urban planners to predict and analyze the impacts of various urban scenarios, addressing a global priority for sustainable urban environments. However, their potential in public engagement for environmental perception remains unfulfilled, with existing research lacking the capability to analyze urbanscapes' visual features and predict public perceptions based on photo-realistic renderings. To fill the gap, our study developed and implemented a UDT platform designed for the dual purposes of objective feature evaluation and subjective visual perception, alongside the prediction of perceptions in simulated scenarios. We incorporated DeepLabV3, a deep learning model for imagery semantic segmentation, to quantify a series of visual features within the built environment, such as the proportion of vegetation and architectural elements. Subjective visual perceptions (e.g. safety and lively) are captured using immersive virtual reality to gather public perceptions of different scenarios and learn patterns. Further, utilizing a photo-realistic rendering engine, high-quality renderings of textures and materials for UDT were achieved, and we proved their veracity based on a perception experiment. Afterwards, we employ the random forest algorithm for automated perception predictions of rendering scenarios. The implementation was demonstrated with a case study on an urban greenway in the central area of Singapore. We compared both the objective evaluation and subjective perception results, followed by a demonstration of automated visual perception prediction through photo-realistic scenario simulations, such as modifying vegetation density or introducing new architectural elements to the skyline, to predict the perception of scenarios before they are built, leading to more efficient and automated urban planning. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

This capability is essential for ensuring the integrity and utility of information, which supports comprehensive insights into urban systems and effective planning. This survey combines hierarchical and multi-dimensional classification to examine how MSIF integrates and analyses diverse datasets, enhancing the operational efficiency and intelligence of urban environments. It highlights the most significant challenges and opportunities presented by MSIF in smart sustainable cities, particularly how it overcomes the limitations of existing approaches in scope and coverage. By considering social, economic, and environmental factors, MSIF offers a multidisciplinary approach that is pivotal for advancing sustainable urban development. Recognized as an essential resource for academics and practitioners, this study promotes a new wave of MSIF innovations aimed at improving the cohesion, efficiency, and sustainability of smart cities. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

"Renewable energy communities for sustainable cities: Economic insights into subsidies, market dynamics and benefits distribution","2025","10.1016/j.apenergy.2025.125752","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105000421731&doi=10.1016%2fj.apenergy.2025.125752&partnerID=40&md5=5d7ba8c531d40de6d42fa1598ae20454","Renewable energy communities (RECs) present a compelling pathway to achieving a just energy transition, particularly in regions such as Europe. Within this context, Italy stands out as a leader in REC development due to its favorable incentive policies, which support widespread adoption. The advancement of RECs requires robust quantitative analyses to illustrate the equitable distribution of economic benefits between prosumers and consumers. This paper presents an economic evaluation of photovoltaic (PV) systems within residential RECs, contributing to the development of sustainable and green urban environments. Using the discounted cash flow method with net present value (NPV) as the primary indicator, the research evaluates various scenarios influenced by subsidies and market dynamics. The findings reveal that PV-based RECs represent highly profitable investments characterized by low economic risk. The NPVs per kW range from €2042–5148 in low-market scenarios and €3347–8195 in high-market scenarios. For RECs comprising four prosumers, the distribution of benefits varies between 15 and 35 %. Additionally, the study introduces two innovative profit-sharing models among renewable self-consumers (RSCs). The first model incentivizes energy-conscious consumption by offering lower trading prices within the REC, while the second model prioritizes energy equity by providing greater support to lower-income households. Both models result in an 18–30 % reduction that encourages prosumer participation, irrespective of individual consumption patterns. Furthermore, the inclusion of consumers alters the distribution of benefits, reinforcing the role played by RECs in fostering socially inclusive energy systems. Ultimately, the economic viability of PV systems within RECs underscores their critical role in advancing energy-sustainable urban development. By simultaneously enhancing environmental resilience and promoting social equity, RECs may serve as a foundational element in the transition towards a greener and more equitable energy future. © 2025 The Authors"

This comes as a contribution to improving social sustainability in smart cities. However, in many developing countries, citizens' participation is still seldom. Henceforth, the introduction of 3D digital participatory planning (3DDPP) needs to be examined and systematically evaluated. This study aims to examine the feasibility of applying 3DDPP in Oman. The study follows an action research approach where a sample of citizens participated in the design of a real governmental project using an interactive 3D digital tool. This was followed by a detailed feasibility evaluation using a set of criteria suggested by the literature. The result revealed that 3DDPP has a high potential to facilitate smooth and successful future applications and improve the participation process in terms of quality, effectiveness, and efficiency. We concluded with recommendations to policymakers to achieve social sustainability during the transition towards smart sustainable cities. The study contributes to social sustainability and participatory planning research with new insights from developing countries where both concepts are still significantly under-studied. The study also contributes a framework for assessing citizens' readiness for 3DDPP and helps to advance efforts to achieve Oman Vision 2040. © 2025 Emerald Publishing Limited: All rights reserved."

Consequently, theuncontrolled rate of urbanization in cities such as Ho in Ghana, continues to threaten the sustainability of urban natural assets and agricultural lands. Although there are existing land use regulations and guidelines to guide and control development, the enforcement of these regulations continues to face major challenges. In light of this, this study evaluates the effectiveness of land use regulations in the Ho Municipality and its implications for sustainable city development. In this study, the researchers relied on both primary and secondary data. The primary data were collected through interviews with representatives of institutions such as the Lands Commission, the Traditional Council, and the Ho Municipal Assembly. In terms secondary data, base maps of the study areas, Medium-Term Development Plans, the Land Use and Spatial Planning Act, 2016 (Act 925) and the Zoning Guidelines and Planning Standards were reviewed, serving as tge framework for the assessment of the extent of compliance. Overall, the findings points to a complex combination of compliance and non-compliance with land use regulations. Whereas compliance with land use regulations and activities in the study areas tend to promote sustainability,non-compliance with these regulations on the other hand threatens urban sustainability. For example, in the Ho Poly Area, there was no evidence of encroachment of the buffer zones of overhead power lines and arterial roads. This indicates that there is compliance with land use regulations, and this has positive implications for the sustainability of the city. However, there were no provisions for urban green spaces in the neighbourhood plan, which raises concerns on the ecological and general sustainability of the city. On this backdrop, the researchers recommend stricter enforcement and the adoption of effective urban planning strategies such as institutional collaboration to achieve sustainable city development. Additionally, adopting emerging techniques such as big data, machine learning, and IoT for urban planning and management in these Ghanaian cities can enhance sustainable development. © 2025 The Author(s)"

While cities offer numerous advantages in meeting the basic needs of a growing population, they also pose less apparent and longer-term health costs. To address the multifaceted impacts of urbanization, an evidence-based design framework for establishing mitigation and regeneration actions is essential. Via a “One Health” approach, this perspective provides recommendations and strategies for the urban ecosystem rehabilitation of future cities, placing biodiversity and ecosystem services at the core of designing healthy and sustainable urban spaces. The framework we propose is based on a Hub and Spoke model to integrate diverse perspectives from public and private sectors and declined in a six-building-blocks structure.

This concept suggests that from every apartment, at least three trees should be visible, 30% of the city’s surface should be covered with greenery, and the nearest park or forest should be no more than 300 m away. However, the lack of detailed guidelines makes the implementation of this concept a significant challenge. The goal of the research presented here was to adapt this concept for Warsaw (Poland) and assess whether it can be considered a green city. We defined parameters such as the maximum distance for visible trees as 20 m and determined what counts toward the 30% green areas. The results showed that 57.82% of apartments in Warsaw have a view of at least three trees, while only 5.44% do not meet this criterion, and the rest meet it only partially. Parks and forests cover 19.95% of the city, while all green areas combined cover 42.01%. Additionally, 45% of buildings are located within 300 m of a park or forest. Ultimately, full compliance with the “3-30-300” concept applies to 22.19% of buildings, while only 12.66% meet the criteria when considering only parks and forests. This indicates that, while Warsaw is relatively green, not all of its areas fulfill these criteria. © 2024 by the authors."

In this context, the public’s demand for high-quality and rich leisure experiences is increasing, and the design, management, and service standards of urban parks are also being upgraded. As an innovative product of the integration of ecological civilisation and information technology, smart interactive parks have become an important direction for promoting sustainable urban development, especially in the landscape design of waterside parks, which show unique significance. This study explores the application of the smart interactive concept in the landscape design of waterside parks from the perspective of sustainable cities, aiming to construct a set of evaluation frameworks to assess its effectiveness and value in urban development. Through in-depth analyses of the smart interaction concept and its application in landscape design, this study combines environmental psychology, landscape ecology, and GIS technology to propose innovative goals, strategies, and design methods for waterside smart interactive landscapes that can support the ecological and social needs of sustainable cities. Domestic and international case studies show that the successful application of smart interactive technologies in waterside parks not only improves environmental quality but also promotes economic development by enhancing the attractiveness of the parks, providing multiple values for sustainable cities. In the empirical research section, this paper takes Haeundae Waterside Park in South Korea as the object of investigation and constructs a design framework based on project selection and indicator quantification to further validate the effectiveness of the practical application of the smart interactive concept in waterside park landscape design. Based on the findings, this paper proposes a series of policy recommendations to promote the construction of smart interactive parks and sustainable urban development. These recommendations not only provide theoretical support for the future development of Haeundae Waterside Park but also provide a reference for the design and planning of public spaces in other cities around the world. By promoting the integration of smart interactive concepts with ecological sustainability, this study provides an innovative reference path for urban planners, landscape architects. and environmentalists to help realise the goal of a sustainable city with coordinated ecological, social, and economic development. © 2025 by the authors."

This notwithstanding, greeneries in African cities have significantly declined over time. There have thus been several calls, notably, to plan for and create green cities by incorporating greeneries in homes and urban neighbourhoods. Achieving this requires local understanding, acceptance and positive attitudes of residents toward planning for and integrating greeneries in homes and the environment. There is however dearth of research in Ghana on the knowledge and willingness of households and city officials to plan for the creation of green cities as well associated barriers. This paper responds to this gap by employing the multi-case approach, comprising of two suburbs (a high- [Nhyiaeso] and low-income [Aboabo] neighbourhoods) in Kumasi, Ghana. A total of 380 households and various relevant city planning agencies were engaged in semi-structured interviews. The findings show considerable but variegate understanding of green cities, which is influenced by several factors such as study community, residency status, housing typology and educational attainment. Most households in both communities indicated their willingness to incorporate greeneries in homes and neighbourhoods. However, resource constraints, nonchalant attitude of some residents and poor maintenance practices, were reported as major barriers that impede the efforts to incorporate greens in homes and communities. Several recommendations are proffered. The study concludes that promoting and achieving the benefits of green cities can be shaped by the knowledge of it; hence, the need to consciously and continually educate households on their importance. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

Compared to other social sciences, archaeological approaches add rigour to envisioning urban sustainability over several centuries and millennia. The archaeology of the pre-Columbian Lowland Maya urban tradition is an interesting case because data have been used to support conflicting arguments about Maya urban sustainability. We suggest that these contradictions can be partly explained by: (1) sustainability being ambiguously defined, (2) subsets of the urban system being expected to indicate the behaviour of other subsets or of the entire system, and (3) processes being evaluated using different timescales. Drawing on 1500 years of urban history at Tikal, this paper examines how archaeological perspectives add depth of reflection and unfold critical assumptions of the meaning of ‘long-term’ and ‘sustainability’ concealed in self-explanatory notions. We outline the development and longevity of urban settlement at Tikal and analyse the blue-black-green (water, soil, vegetation) infrastructures that sustained urban metabolism and sponsored basic urban functions. Our analyses contribute new insights on the challenges associated with future sustainability transitions over varying temporal scales. The diversity of past and present urban systems and infrastructural initiatives cannot be fitted within a single narrative of urban sustainability, however, and much research is required to examine how blue-black-green infrastructures can support transformative change of aggregated human population zones struggling with potable water scarcity, soil degradation, and habitat and biodiversity loss. © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2024."

This study aimed to evaluate the carbon sequestration potential of common plant species in urban residential areas and provide recommendations for optimizing green space design and management. Methods: The research was conducted in four residential areas of Nanjing, China, where key growth parameters of 20 plant species, including evergreen trees, deciduous trees, evergreen shrubs, and deciduous shrubs, were measured. The assimilation method was employed to calculate carbon sequestration per unit canopy area and for entire plants. Results: The results showed that the carbon sequestration capacities of different plant species and types exhibited significant differences, with p-values less than 0.05. In terms of daily carbon sequestration per unit canopy projection area, the ranking was as follows: evergreen trees > evergreen shrubs > deciduous trees > deciduous shrubs. For total plant carbon sequestration, the ranking was: evergreen trees > deciduous trees > evergreen shrubs > deciduous shrubs. Evergreen trees performed excellently in both carbon sequestration metrics, with the average daily carbon sequestration per unit canopy projection area and for the entire plant being 18.0024 g/(m2·d) and 462.28 g/d, respectively. The study also observed seasonal variations, with carbon sequestration rates being higher in autumn and summer compared to spring and winter. During the summer, the average daily carbon sequestration per unit canopy projection area and for the entire plant were 11.975 g/(m2·d) and 161.744 g/d, respectively, while in autumn, these values were 13.886 g/(m2·d) and 98.458 g/d. Seasonal variations were also observed, with autumn and summer exhibiting higher carbon sequestration rates compared to spring and winter. Additionally, CO2 concentrations were monitored across the four residential areas, providing insights into the spatial and temporal dynamics of carbon sequestration. Discussion: Based on the findings, optimization strategies were proposed, such as prioritizing the selection and integration of high-performing evergreen tree species in urban green space design and incorporating diverse plant types to enhance year-round carbon sequestration. This study contributes to the development of sustainable urban planning and landscape management practices, promoting the role of green spaces in mitigating climate change and enhancing urban resilience.

In particular, designers must consider the principles of aesthetics and adapt the lighting to the architectural style and details of the facilities while ensuring energy efficiency and minimising the impact on the natural environment. For single objects, the task is relatively simple. The problem arises when the task is to develop a lighting concept for a large ensemble. Computer applications strictly dedicated to lighting analysis cannot capture a 3D model rich in architectural detail. The article presents a case study that focuses on a comprehensive approach to designing the floodlighting of a complex of architectural objects. The steps for designing the floodlighting of objects are presented. Based on a computer simulation, a visual lighting concept and a detailed analysis of the luminance distribution and floodlighting efficiency were presented. The obtained average luminance levels are consistent with recommendations and standards, and the project is characterised by a high lighting efficiency of 56%. This approach enables an understanding of how light affects architectural structures and the surroundings, which is crucial to achieving harmony between the technical side of the project and its aesthetics. The project presented in the article is an inspiring example of how a comprehensive approach to illumination can contribute to creating an attractive night landscape of the city, taking into account the aspects of sustainable development. This is very important nowadays, when the floodlighting of architectural objects is often considered an element of the landscape that can be omitted. © 2024 by the author."

This study investigates the relationship between urban form and crime incidents in public spaces within the center of the city. This study was conducted in the city of Łódź, located in central Poland. Through geolocated data, this research explores crime incidents that, while not the most severe, disrupt public order and impact the overall quality of life. This study fills a gap in the existing literature by analyzing spatial variables such as urban vibrancy and the presence of alcohol outlets, alongside other urban elements. The analysis incorporates a variety of urban form variables, including land development indices, the functional layout of the urban neighborhood, pedestrian infrastructure, public space amenities, and facilities. Urban vibrancy, represented by the density of human activity, is also assessed in relation to crime incidents. The results indicate significant correlations between certain urban features and the occurrence of crime incidents, particularly the presence of public amenities and small businesses. While these findings suggest that urban design can influence crime rates, further panel and time-series regression analysis is needed to confirm these dynamics. Aligned with the 11th Sustainable Development Goal, this study provides insights that could inform urban planning strategies, offering recommendations to enhance both the functionality and safety of city centers. By understanding how urban design elements contribute to public safety, policymakers can develop more effective and targeted spatial planning strategies that promote not only aesthetics and functionality but also the well-being and security of residents. © 2025 by the authors."
"Ecological Aspects in Urban Streetscape Design Based on Users' Preferences Towards Green City","2024","10.13189/cea.2024.120615","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85206559627&doi=10.13189%2fcea.2024.120615&partnerID=40&md5=dd91a1388a89097f9206e7396c5568e4","Urban streetscape is a part of city space that reflects the quality of streetscape design and visual effects. Sustainable streetscape design considers several aspects, namely environment, architectural, economic and social. One aspect of streetscape design is the ecological aspect. This research aims to analyse user’s preferences for implementing ecological aspects in streetscapes’ design, thereby increasing ecosystem balance and minimizing negative impacts on the environment. This research uses quantitative methods. The research was carried out in the center of Medan City. Several variables used in the ecological aspect are the availability of open space, facade, vegetation, street furniture, and drainage. Data collection was carried out by distributing questionnaires to people in Medan City, and the analysis used is descriptive. The research results show that green open spaces should be easily accessible and connected to sidewalks. The building facade provides an attractive visual impression. Vegetation on pedestrian paths can provide a sense of comfort for pedestrians. The provision of street furniture on the sidewalk should be in an attractive form and provide a feeling of comfort for users. Drainage is needed to handle rainwater runoff so that flooding can be prevented. The streetscape design concept was prepared with the application of ecological aspects that could support a green city. Providing a comfortable and attractive streetscape can increase walkability in a city. Copyright©2024 by authors, all rights reserved."

We investigate urban planning of road networks in the Buraydah City, Al Qassim, Saudi Arabia using techniques from fractal geometry via fractal dimension (a non-integer number which measures geometric complexity of an object) calculations. The main objective is to study the fractal structure of the road network of the Buraydah city. To accomplish this goal we provide simulation results and compare various kinds of fractal dimensions including box dimension (Dbox), capacity dimension (Dcap), information dimension (Dinf), correlation dimension (Dcor), and probability dimension (Dprob) for the entire road network of the Buraydah city. The study reveals that better planning and optimization of road networks for urban sustainability can be obtained using these fractal indicators. The computational experiments are done using QGIS software and open source fractal dimension programs to understand fractal spatial patterns in the road network. © 2025 The Author(s)."

This research analyzes data from the European Union between 2011 and 2020 by deploying the first-difference generalized method of moments (FM-GMM) model to distinguish between two different effects of the human capital variable—a low effect (negative influence) and a high effect (positive influence). The analysis has identified an optimal threshold value of 1.867 for the human capital index (HCI) score in the context of European Union countries. This threshold value represents a critical point at which the effect of human capital on achieving SDG-11, which aims to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable, undergoes a significant shift. The impact of renewable energy consumption on SDG-11 exhibits a non-linear pattern. There is a negative relationship at lower levels of renewable energy adoption (below a certain threshold), with renewable energy negatively impacting SDG-11 progress at a 1% significance level. However, the relationship becomes significantly positive once renewable energy consumption surpasses this threshold. This non-linearity suggests that achieving mass renewable energy adoption is crucial to unlocking its full potential in promoting the sustainable urban development goals captured by SDG-11. The results also demonstrate a positive effect on natural resource productivity both before and after exceeding a specific threshold, although the magnitude of this effect varies. This robust evidence underscores the necessity for targeted policies in the European Union to enhance human capital, increase renewable energy adoption, and boost natural resource productivity, thereby securing sustainable funding mechanisms for SDG-11. © 2025 by the authors."

The demand for urban environmental protection involving broad participation of human (e.g., citizens) is rising. Media play a key role in promoting environmental protection awareness and behaviors of citizens. However, there is still a disconnect between media information and citizens' awareness and behaviors, of which the synergistic associations have not been analyzed. This study synthetically explored the coupling relationship between media channels (including traditional & digital media) and environmental protection awareness & behaviors of citizens in Chinese cities through the questionnaire survey. Although the usage rate of traditional media was approximately 50% of that of digital media, traditional media had a significantly greater impact on bridging the gaps between environmental protection awareness and behaviors. Among citizens using the digital media, 60% exhibited weak awareness (e.g., concern level, risk awareness, anxious psychology and cognitive level) and behavior motivation (including recycling, low-carbon living, and public welfare) regarding environmental protection. Improvement measures were further proposed, including strengthening top-level government design, leveraging advanced digital technology, and providing more incentives to citizens.

The proposed system integrates wind turbines, a water electrolyzer, three-stage hydrogen compressor, heat recovery and storage, a two-stage Organic Rankine Cycle (TS-ORC), hydrogen storage tanks, a Vapor Compression Refrigeration Cycle (VCRC), and a hydrogen dispenser. Waste heat from the hydrogen compression process is harnessed to power the TS-ORC, where the first stage drives the VCRC and the second stage generates additional electricity. A comprehensive assessment of the system confirmed the system's compliance with the principles of thermodynamics. The results indicate an overall system efficiency of 25.4 %, and the wind turbines alone achieve 46.21 % efficiency. The overall exergy destruction rate of the system is computed to be 2,120 kW and the main exergy destruction occurs in wind turbines and water electrolyzer. The first and second stages of the ORC exhibit efficiencies of 14.45 % and 6.05 %, respectively, while the VCRC yields a Coefficient of Performance (COP) of 1.24. The specific energy consumption for electrolytic hydrogen production, compression, and pre-cooling are calculated as 58.83, 1.99, and 0.29 kWh/kg, respectively.

East Asian and Pacific economies are vulnerable to climate crises and striving for sustainability by transition to green energy and taking climate initiatives. In the past, no study has explored the effectiveness of energy transitions and climate actions in the context of East Asia and Pacific. To understand the effectiveness of these efforts, this study has been planned and executed to examine the impact of energy transition and climate actions, along with emissions from residential and commercial buildings, per capita income, and effective governance, on sustainable cities and communities in East Asia and the Pacific region. The study utilizes panel data of six high-income countries and 11 lower-middle and upper-middle income countries from 2000 to 2022 for comparative empirical analysis. Empirical analysis is performed using truncated regression due to the nature of the data. The study found that energy transition, climate actions, and governance effectiveness increase the sustainability of cities and communities. However, emissions from residential buildings and per capita income adversely affect the sustainability of cities and communities. Furthermore, the dynamics of energy transition and climate change vary according to the income classifications of East Asian and Pacific countries. Energy transition and emissions showed a higher impact in HICs, while climate actions were more resilient in lower-middle and upper-middle income countries. These findings emphasize the transition to clean and green energy, prompt climate policy actions, and effective governance to ensure sustainability in East Asian and Pacific cities and communities. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

This approach is consistent with the hypothesis of a presumed Chinese style of policy transfers, according to which Chinese policymakers learn from abroad selectively and gradually. This study aims to test this hypothesis by analyzing one of these eco-city collaborations: the transfer of “Careful Urban Renewal” to the city of Yangzhou. Through a longitudinal study that looked at policy developments over the period 2003–2019 and a focus on the “demand side” of policy mobilities, it illustrates that transfers concerned several policy aspects, going beyond technical recommendations. This disconfirms the hypothesis of a consistent policy transfer style, as no specific policy preference could be spotted. Rather, the analysis of the policy process illustrated that different policy transfer styles emerged in the period considered. Variations in policy transfer style can be ascribed to the willingness, motivations, and interests of specific individuals, in particular city party secretaries and local bureaucrats, as well as to the room of maneuver and resources these actors possess, in turn, determined by the institutional structures in which they operate. Situational factors also led to variations. While this single case study cannot encompass all variations of policy transfer style, it is nonetheless hoped that this research inspires more longitudinal studies, which in turn can contribute to a promising discussion in policy studies and urban studies. © The Author(s) 2024."

Among these, the fifth goal focuses on gender equality, which has become increasingly important in various nations. Notably, there is a recognized connection between SDG 11, which pertains to sustainable cities, and SDG 5. The concept of smart cities under SDG 11 is viewed as pivotal in enhancing gender equality. However, existing research exploring the relationship between smart cities and gender equality remains limited. Methods: This study employs a bibliometric review technique utilizing the Bibliometrix tool to conduct a comprehensive analysis of literature related to SDG 5, SDG 11, and smart cities. This method allows for an extensive examination of existing research articles to identify trends and themes within the literature. Results: The analysis revealed that many research articles frequently cited terms associated with sustainability, community, design, transportation, and mobility. It was found that most studies focusing on SDG 5 and SDG 11 through the lens of smart cities primarily aim to: (1) Understand and promote sustainability principles. (2) Address social issues. (3) Develop inclusive solutions. (4) Improve transportation for women and their commuting needs. Additionally, there is a noted increase in scholarly interest regarding health and climate issues about SDGs 5 and 11. Discussion: The findings indicate a significant gap in the literature concerning the interplay between smart cities and gender equality, suggesting that further research is necessary to understand this relationship fully. The emphasis on sustainability principles and inclusive solutions highlights the potential for smart city initiatives to contribute positively to gender equality. As interest in health and climate issues grows within this context, it underscores the need for integrated approaches that address multiple dimensions of sustainable development while promoting gender equity.

Therefore, the health status of these bearings directly influences the safe operation of the infrastructure. Accurate and reliable diagnosis of defects in these components minimizes downtime, reduces maintenance costs, and prevents major accidents, ultimately providing insights in the construction and management of a sustainable city. Typically, in actual industrial scenarios, varying working conditions and various types of machines can result in significant discrepancies in the distribution of sample data. Moreover, the non-negligible noise may degrade the diagnostic performance. Therefore, realizing an accurate and reliable bearing diagnosis considering the cross-domain and noise environment remains a challenge. Leveraging the merits of information fusion and multi-source domain transfer learning, this article proposes a multi-source domain feature-decision dual fusion adversarial transfer network (DFATN) to break through the aforesaid limitations. Initially, an adversarial transfer framework is developed, incorporating novel feature matching evaluation and joint distribution difference losses. This framework is designed to facilitate the learning of feature invariants across domains and to enhance the sharing of domain-specific knowledge, even in noise. Relying on channel-spatial interactive feature fusion, a multi-scale feature extractor (MFE) is constructed to share the interaction and enhance the modeling of complex features in multiple dimensions. Additionally, a fault state-related decision fusion mechanism (SDF) is also implemented to integrate diagnostic information, significantly enhancing the generalization performance and robustness of the proposed network. By employing both public Paderborn University (PU) and laboratory-collected (Lab) datasets, the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed DFATN on bearing fault diagnosis are validated. For cross-working condition tasks, the proposed method realizes impressive performance, with average accuracies of 96.52% and 98.76% for Paderborn University (PU) and laboratory-collected (Lab) datasets, respectively. For cross-machine tasks, the average accuracy is 83.36%, outperforming other latest cross-domain fault diagnosis techniques. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

This study presents the design of a Botanical Garden to address this issue by serving as a conservation center for native flora. A baseline assessment was conducted to evaluate meteorological conditions, soil properties, and the quality of treated wastewater from the “La Escalerilla” plant. The analysis revealed a semi-arid climate with low precipitation and suitable soil conditions. A total of 685 plant species were identified and proposed for conservation within the garden, with a high proportion of endemic species. To protect the future plant species, a living fence composed of 700 individuals was installed, considering resilient species such as Molle serrano (Schinus molle), Cantuta (Cantua buxifolia), and Huaranguillo (Tephrosia cinerea), which were installed at an average height of 50 cm and have grown to an average of 80 cm after 8 months. This study demonstrates the feasibility of establishing a botanical garden in Arequipa’s arid environment and serves as a model for future botanical garden projects in arid regions at the national and regional levels, providing a foundation for natural landscapes in urban areas. © 2025 by the authors."
"The role of strategic planning in Nature- based Solutions (NBS) transformation: An evaluation of the Green Cities Framework in mainstreaming NBS in 6 European countries","2024","10.1016/j.nbsj.2024.100157","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85214695968&doi=10.1016%2fj.nbsj.2024.100157&partnerID=40&md5=1bbf43e0b8c21651e3577d0c3218a9f1","Urban areas are currently experiencing a number of adverse effects associated with both climate induced change and the nature of development processes. This has led to, not only a reduction in the provision and performance of environmental attributes but has also generated threats to the well-being of urban inhabitants. In response, the concept of Nature- based Solutions (NBS) has emerged as a means of reconfiguring spatial interactions to maximize adaptation and resilience. Despite this however, the process of transition for NBS has frequently encountered several governance related challenges. This paper examines the extent to which the Green Cities Framework (GCF) can overcome these limitations and aid NBS mainstreaming. Through policy-based experimentation in six European Cities we assess the ability of the GCF to deliver improved NBS capacity and innovation. The research revealed positive strategic planning improvements in all cities studied. Particular areas of strength included improvements to NBS visioning, working group collaboration, climate impact and vulnerability assessment, integration with existing planning instruments and processes, business model development and post-decision evaluation. Several areas of potential improvement were also revealed. These were primarily associated with difficulties in communicating with all relevant actors, concerns with undertaking financial assessments and defining NBS standards for procurement. © 2024 The Author(s)"
"Dynamic Evaluation of Road Network Resilience to Traffic Accidents: An Emergency Management Perspective for Sustainable Cities in China","2024","10.3390/su16177385","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85203983439&doi=10.3390%2fsu16177385&partnerID=40&md5=a1ab7871559c0fd1d00678479710a0cc","When assessing road network resilience, emergency management behavior should be considered, as this represents the road network’s capacity to adapt to and recover from traffic accidents. Given the timeliness and variability of emergency management behavior, deterministic approaches seem inadequate to represent real road network performance. Thus, this paper innovatively designs an emergency management perspective-based dynamic evaluation method of road network resilience to traffic accidents. Firstly, based on four stages of emergency management, a road network resilience evaluation index system encompassing resilience capabilities, resilience attributes and traffic accident emergency management ability indicators is constructed. Afterwards, the gray relational technique for order preference by similarity to the ideal solution (GRA-TOPSIS) evaluation method based on combination weighting, which integrates factor analysis with hesitant intuitionistic fuzzy expert scoring, is designed to quantify resilience. Finally, the obstacle degree model is utilized for identifying resilience constraints as the input of a long short-term memory (LSTM) model to predict the resilience variation trend. The fast road network of Shanghai in China is adopted as a case study, and the results indicate that road network resilience embodies significant spatial distribution characteristics. Road length, number of tractors, perception and response and disposal time of traffic accidents cast notable effects on resilience. Additionally, some roads are forecast to show descending resilience. The proposed method is valuable for helping policymakers identify current and potential vulnerable roads and to formulate proposals to effectively improve the resilience of urban agglomerations and promote sustainable cities. © 2024 by the authors."

Buildings are particularly energy-intensive, generating about one third of global energy-related carbon emissions. Compared with active solutions (like mechanical systems), passive solutions offer the potential to balance energy consumption, thermal comfort, and ecological benefits. One potential solution is the integration of green glass space (GGS) into passive building design. GGS is a transitional building space with glass curtain walls that exhibit excellent insulation performance during winter. However, GGS is susceptible to overheating during summer, which limits its applicability. Therefore, this work proposes a strategy of integrating vertical greenery into GGS, leveraging the nature-based solution of greenery (i.e., flourishes in summer and withers in winter) to address this seasonal challenge of GGS. The results demonstrated that the strategic application of vertical greenery can effectively mitigate the overheating in GGS and improve comprehensive benefits. By using full coverage of vertical greenery in a linear layout, the air temperature of GGS and cooling energy consumption were largely reduced by 8.02°C and 12.2%, respectively, while the carbon abatement was enhanced by up to 101.11 tons. Based on a comprehensive evaluation of energy, economy, and environmental benefits, it is recommended to use a greenery configuration with 50% coverage in a vertical linear layout for GGS. The integration of greenery into building design can mitigate adverse environmental impacts, reduce energy consumption, and contribute to the sustainable development of low-carbon cities. © Science China Press 2024."

This study empirically examines the impact of digital infrastructure on urban green transformation using panel data from 279 prefecture-level and above cities in China spanning 2006 to 2022, employing a multiple time point difference-in-differences approach. Results indicate a significant positive effect of digital infrastructure construction on urban economic green transformation. Digital infrastructure primarily promotes green transformation through pollution reduction, technology agglomeration, and structural optimization effects, with technological innovation and the integration of manufacturing and service industries being stable mechanisms. Environmental regulations, government strategic guidance, and institutional environments reinforce this effect. The promotion effect is more pronounced in the central region and exhibits a pro-poor characteristic, benefiting smaller, non-resource-based cities, and areas with higher information and communication technology application levels. In expansive analysis, the spillover effect of the “Broadband China” pilot policy may strengthen over time. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

However, the fact that citizens' participation (CP) is not adherent to the current policies and governance often boosts their aspirations of decision-making to become smart cities. This paper aims to identify SSC variables and, more importantly, rank, categorise and discuss the factors towards implementing SSC by engaging, empowering and enabling citizens to participate in the urban development of SSC. Design/methodology/approach: A comprehensive literature review identified 38 factors in the CP process. Those factors were used to design an online questionnaire administered to the respondents. A total of 164 valid responses were collected. A two-stage statistical analysis was adopted. First, the Relative Importance Index (RII) was used to rank and prioritise the importance of the factors that affect the current policies and agenda. Second, factor analysis was utilised to categorise and group those factors. Findings: This study founds four significant factors that help in implanting SSC: “knowledge of smart sustainable cities”, “awareness of smart sustainable cities”, “willingness of the citizens to participate” and “opinion on the current agenda of the government's role”. Research limitations/implications: This study has a few limitations which can be considered in future studies. First, the response rate of the participant is relatively low (163), so sampling a larger segment will support the broader perception of the citizens. Practical implications: The outcome of this paper underlines the need for the successful implementation of smart cities by adopting CP in the process of impacting policies and governance. Particularly, it identifies factors that help cities and policymakers in engaging CP in developing new policies and revising existing policies for promoting SSC. Originality/value: There is a need to investigate the most critical factors that influence CP for implementing SSC. These factors have not been adequately examined in extant literature. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Bekasi City facing flood many years as an impact this problem. In early 2020, flooding points in Bekasi City reached 58 points with an area of around 15.37 ha or 73% of the city area with a depth of 1-4 meters. Looking at its history, the longer the flooding, the wider and depth. In 2005 the inundation area ranged from 164 ha, then in 2018, the inundation area increased to 12353 ha. The funds spent on flood management almost one-third of regional budget. The question that should be asked is why flooding still occurs, even though the efforts that have been made are not small. The social, economic and environmental impacts of flooding are significant. If it continues uncontrol, it is feared that the sustainability of Bekasi City is threatened. Therefore, a big picture of the current flood control system in Bekasi City is needed. This study identified that the critical gap in urban environmental risk management strategies in Bekasi City, Indonesia, is the necessity of incorporating community participation and non-structural measures to establish flood-resilient communities and mitigate risk. Addressing this management deficiency will contribute to the realization of a resilient and sustainable Bekasi City. © 2024 The authors."

Through the analysis, the paper interrogates how the urban sustainability idea, with the recognition of the roles played by spaces beyond city boundaries, is unfolding, with a particular focus on the negotiations taking place between a city and hinterlands. The objective also extends to revealing how the initiative reinterprets city–hinterland relationships. This research identified that the initiative was shaped based on the city's understanding of the issue, which allowed the city to have a dominant influence in the following negotiations to arrange the initiative's details. Through the investigation of those negotiations, evidence showed the presence of power asymmetries and the hinterlands’ vulnerability to ‘being used’ by a city and raised questions on the initiative's quality to deliver desirable outcomes. The paper discusses them as this initiative's weaknesses, which are also areas for future studies to investigate how the city–hinterland soft space approach could enhance urban sustainability. © The Author(s) 2025."

However, not every POS is being efficiently utilized, while the inefficient POSs occupy large areas and can negatively affect socio-economic development, thus posing a threat to sustainable city development. Existing studies evaluate POSs solely based on benefit outcomes, but ignore POS functional types and contextual environments. To address this issue, a categorized, integrated, and relative evaluation method, i.e., utilization efficiency (UE), is proposed to identify inefficient POSs, where essentially measures the ratio from benefit outcome to resource occupation of each POS. We firstly classify POSs into five types by considering their core functions, then measure their UEs to extract efficient and inefficient POS, and finally visualize key causes of different types of POS. Our results reveal 3,138 inefficient out of 10,943 POSs in Beijing, and show the inefficient POSs that are concentrated in the southern Beijing and northern regions between the 5th and 6th ring roads, mainly affected by local population density and environmental resource. Drawing on the features of inefficient POSs, it is suggested to increase small green spaces and sky gardens in the downtown areas, improve service facilities and basic tourism infrastructure in the suburbs. Accordingly, this study firstly incorporates POS functional types and resource occupation into the utilization efficiency evaluation, providing spatial optimization recommendations of POSs to facilitate sustainable city development. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

In the same context, the Smart Green City project, which began in earnest at the end of 2020, initially attracted national attention due to the strong will of the administration. However, limitations in its performance were revealed. This study aimed to identify the policy mechanisms that led the Korean government to pursue the Smart Green City project using a critical juncture approach and to derive useful implications for policy selection. A critical juncture framework was applied for in-depth analysis, and a descriptive case study based on critical thinking was conducted. The results confirmed that endogenous and exogenous environmental changes surrounding the government at critical junctures were mechanisms for establishing the Smart Green City project. In addition, the government’s attempt to differentiate itself from the policies of previous governments was confirmed to be a constraint that actually hindered the project’s progress. This study concludes that if a government facing a complex crisis makes hasty policy decisions, it is likely to repeat the policy pattern or institutional path of previous governments. It also argued that in this situation, policy choices that aim to cut a new path may cause the government to choose a wrong path, which may have irreversible consequences. © 2024 by the author."

Design/methodology/approach: This paper asks how the expectations and use values of the professionals and residents involved in developing, designing, managing and living in a sustainable neighborhood can shape sustainability indicators that affect progress towards project goals. Taking as its focus The Sustainable City (TSC), a neighborhood in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE), the paper develops data from in-depth, go-along interviews with 46 different actors. Findings: Findings indicate that when given the opportunity to express their opinion, many actors will prioritize metrics different than the metrics dictated to the by sustainability experts and international rating systems. The findings suggest that NSA tools should place greater emphasis on local factors, public engagement and operational concerns. Practical implications: The paper provides a method that any community can replicate to better understand the different use values of local actors and establish its own NSA tool. This can help experts learn how design, management and operational decisions interact to impact different dimensions of performance.

However, not all citizens engage in participatory place (re)making because their attachment to the place varies. In addition, different opinions of how to enhance place attractiveness exist. This paper aims to explore the role of place attachment and attractiveness in participatory sustainable urban development. The research question is: how do city managers and decision makers incorporate place attachment and attractiveness while engaging citizens in sustainable city (re)making? By adopting a case study approach with empirical focus on the sustainable development of Näsby district, Kristianstad City (Sweden), this paper shows that a key element of participatory place (re)making is to address both attractiveness and attachment simultaneously and throughout the entire process. City managers and decision makers should be aware of the intertwined nature of place attractiveness and attachment, coined as “attra-chment”, by thinking about the multiple bonds that citizens have with their place, as well as what they find attractive, i.e. what they like and want. When citizens’ emotional attachment to the place is considered and valued in all phases of participatory sustainable urban development, their engagement in place (re)making can be a propulsive force for attractiveness. © The Author(s) 2024."

Furthermore, it is essential to reduce the external costs associated with urban transportation, including environmental pollution, noise, congestion, and accidents, to foster sustainable cities. Choosing the right urban transportation system can meet this goal, but it is not an accessible business for decision-makers in the face of several conflicting criteria and ambiguities in the evaluation process. To cope with this, the current paper suggests a multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) framework consisting of fuzzy BWM (Best–Worst method) and fuzzy MAIRCIA (Multi-Attribute Ideal-Real Comparative Analysis) techniques. This extended MCGDM approach has been applied to evaluate six urban transport systems, namely, Trams, Light Rail Trams, Metro (Subway), Bus Rapid Transport, Commuter Trains, and Public Buses based on 11 selection criteria which we have determined after consultation with highly experienced professionals. The fuzzy BWM technique is employed to identify the weights of the criteria. The fuzzy MAIRCA technique is utilized for ranking the alternatives using the calculated weights of the criteria. The proposed approach's validation has been examined with an extensive robustness check. The study is conducted from a general perspective, i.e., not restricted to a particular city. However, with the identified selection criteria, the proposed decision-making procedure can be repeated for a specific city considering any specific requirements, constraints, or limitations of that city. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023."

Smart Cities as Hyper-Connected Digital Environments generate large and diverse data streams and repositories that do not consistently translate into insights and decisions. A Responsible AI Hyper-Automation framework with Generative AI agents is developed and evaluated to address these complex challenges. What are the implications of the main findings? The developed AI framework is effective when grounded on five core technical capabilities with an independent cognitive engine for hyper-automated agentic AI that feeds into human-in-the-loop processes. The framework provides a prototypical setting for university cities of the future to provide direction, guidance, and standards for sustainable and safe smart cities of the future. Smart cities are Hyper-Connected Digital Environments (HCDEs) that transcend the boundaries of natural, human-made, social, virtual, and artificial environments. Human activities are no longer confined to a single environment as our presence and interactions are represented and interconnected across HCDEs. The data streams and repositories of HCDEs provide opportunities for the responsible application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that generates unique insights into the constituent environments and the interplay across constituents. The translation of data into insights poses several complex challenges originating in data generation and then propagating through the computational layers to decision outcomes. To address these challenges, this article presents the design and development of a Hyper-Automated AI framework with Generative AI agents for sustainable smart cities. The framework is empirically evaluated in the living lab setting of a ‘University City of the Future’. The developed AI framework is grounded on the core capabilities of acquisition, preparation, orchestration, dissemination, and retrospection, with an independent cognitive engine for hyper-automation of these AI capabilities using Generative AI. Hyper-automation output feeds into a human-in-the-loop process prior to decision-making outcomes. More broadly, this framework aims to provide a validated pathway for university cities of the future to take up the role of prototypes that deliver evidence-based guidelines for the development and management of sustainable smart cities. © 2025 by the authors."

The research starts by performing two systematic literature reviews about both paradigms and, after that, employs a thematic analysis to identify key themes, definitions, and characteristics that differentiate and connect these two urban development concepts. The findings reveal more similarities than differences between the two paradigms. Despite this, some key differences are identified. Smart cities are characterized by their use of advanced information and communication technologies to enhance urban infrastructure, improve public services, and optimize resource management. In contrast, sustainable cities focus on environmental conservation, social equity, and economic viability to ensure long-term urban resilience and quality of life. This study is important because it clarifies both concepts and highlights the potential for integrating smart and sustainable city strategies to address contemporary urban challenges more holistically. The findings also suggest a convergence towards the concept of ‘smart sustainable cities’, which leverage technology to achieve sustainability goals. Finally, this study concludes by identifying research gaps and proposing a future research agenda to further understand and optimize the synergy between smart and sustainable urban development paradigms. © 2024 by the authors."

A major hindrance to their widespread adoption is the scarcity of charging stations and the absence of grid access. This study explores and examines four distinct ways to enhance the energy grid of buildings. The primary goal of these solutions is to generate more capacity without raising the peak electricity load of the building through the incorporation of energy storage technologies. The target location is Southern Ontario, Canada, which is one of most populated regions in Canada. Strategy 3 stands out as the most promising alternative, with an impressive 35 % increase in charging station capacity compared to other strategies. Using this method, it is feasible to store 353.4 GWh of energy during the summer and 480.1 GWh during the winter. In summer, the station can release 243.1 GWh, and in the winter, 345.6 GWh of energy can be efficiently used to charge electric vehicles. Strategy 4, which includes hydrogen generation and fuel cell systems, offers a competitive alternative with a 28 % increase in capacity. This method allows for charging station capabilities of 52 GW during the summer and 13 GW during the winter. The strategies emphasize the importance of adaptable capacity solutions to address variations in demand on a seasonal and daily basis while considering both economic and environmental sustainability. As the adoption of electric vehicles continues to rise, the nuanced operational aspects of these strategies are pivotal for the development of sustainable and efficient transportation ecosystems, ensuring that electric vehicle charging infrastructure keeps pace with the growing demand. © 2024 The Author(s)"

Despite the significance of the topic and considerable research on COVID-19, the pandemic’s unequal impact on Sydney’s disadvantaged areas remains unexplored. Urban location, ethnicity, education and employment status have affected the impact of COVID-19. This research argues that the socioeconomic impacts of the pandemic have also been spatially differentiated in Sydney, with socioeconomically underprivileged people in Western Sydney more affected than those privileged elsewhere. The disadvantaged areas of Western Sydney support the case of a broad vision of socioeconomic transformation for resilience. This study uses qualitative research to reveal unequal COVID-19 impacts in Sydney. It emphasizes the introduction of socioeconomic innovations concentrating on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to support disadvantaged urban regions in enhancing resilience and sustainability in challenging times and beyond. © 2025 The Author(s).

"Toward smart sustainable cities: assessment of stakeholders' readiness for digital participatory planning","2024","10.1108/ARCH-06-2023-0159","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85174420961&doi=10.1108%2fARCH-06-2023-0159&partnerID=40&md5=2205dbcb537c3042bf61f35a5023dc9b","Purpose: This study aims to assess the readiness of both citizens and the government for digital participatory planning (DDP) as a contribution to the undergoing transformative shift toward smart and sustainable cities to address the challenges posed by rapid urbanization. While much attention has been devoted to leveraging technology to mitigate these challenges, there has been a relative lack of emphasis on engaging stakeholders in the planning process in a smart and inclusive manner. DPP stands as a cornerstone for the development of sustainable and smart cities. However, before DPP can be effectively implemented on the ground, it is crucial to assess the city readiness for DPP to ensure its success. This assessment is undertaken as part of Oman's broader initiative to transition into sustainable smart cities in alignment with the goals outlined in Oman Vision 2040. Design/methodology/approach: A generic evaluation framework was identified, validated and customized to the local context by experts using the pile sorting technique based on the social constructivism theory. Then, the revised framework was used to evaluate the readiness of a sample of local citizens and government officials in Oman for the DPP concept. Findings: The inferential statistical analysis revealed that citizens are willing to participate in DPP when trust and transparency with policymakers are enhanced. On the government side, the results showed that there is adequate infrastructure that can enable DPP, and planners have a positive attitude toward DPP provided that trust in citizens' opinions is strengthened. This study concludes with a roadmap for preparation for DPP implementation in smart sustainable cities mandated by Oman Vision 2040. The findings and roadmap can inform policy development, decision-making and urban planning practices toward more inclusive, participatory and technologically enabled urban environments. Originality/value: The study contributes to the existing body of knowledge by emphasizing the significance of stakeholders' smart involvement in planning processes, social sustainability, evaluating city readiness for DPP and providing practical recommendations for DPP implementation in the context of smart sustainable cities. At a theoretical level, the study contributes a framework for assessing readiness for DPP and emphasizes that mutual trust is not only important for conventional participation practices but it is also essential for smart citizens. This study argues that a building or a city is not sustainable unless it is seen as such by its stakeholders, including the end users. Therefore, effective and smart involvement of the citizens in smart city planning is a precondition for the success of the future cities. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited."

In this paper, we argue that eco-gentrification as a phenomenon is entering the Nordic countries. We illustrate this with a case study of the fast-growing, medium-sized Finnish city of Tampere, where the transformation of a former welfare city into a “sustainable city” is creating unintended gentrification. In the analysis, we identify three inner-city neighborhoods facing eco-gentrification where an increasing drive for urban densification has replaced the welfare state ethos of social equality. We name the types of eco-gentrification as retrofitting, remaking, and preserving. In the concluding part, we elaborate on the serious and multifaceted challenges of keeping welfare state ideals alive in times of green growth urbanism. © The Author(s) 2024."

However, not all citizens engage in participatory place (re)making because their attachment to the place varies. In addition, different opinions of how to enhance place attractiveness exist. This paper aims to explore the role of place attachment and attractiveness in participatory sustainable urban development. The research question is: how do city managers and decision makers incorporate place attachment and attractiveness while engaging citizens in sustainable city (re)making? By adopting a case study approach with empirical focus on the sustainable development of Näsby district, Kristianstad City (Sweden), this paper shows that a key element of participatory place (re)making is to address both attractiveness and attachment simultaneously and throughout the entire process. City managers and decision makers should be aware of the intertwined nature of place attractiveness and attachment, coined as “attra-chment”, by thinking about the multiple bonds that citizens have with their place, as well as what they find attractive, i.e. what they like and want. When citizens’ emotional attachment to the place is considered and valued in all phases of participatory sustainable urban development, their engagement in place (re)making can be a propulsive force for attractiveness. © The Author(s) 2024."

The purpose of this scoping review was to map the published literature that assessed the association between the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11, which tried to make cities and human settlements safe, inclusive, resilient and sustainable, and ECC. Methods: This scoping review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. In July 2023, a search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus using tailored search terms related to housing, urbanization, waste management practices, and ECC. Studies that solely examined ECC prevalence without reference to SDG11 goals were excluded. Of those that met the inclusion criteria, a summary highlighting the countries and regions where the studies were conducted, the study designs employed, and the findings were done. In addition, the studies were also linked to relevant SDG11 targets. Results: Ten studies met the inclusion criteria with none from the African Region. Six studies assessed the association between housing and ECC, with findings suggesting that children whose parents owned a house had lower ECC prevalence and severity. Other house related parameters explored were size, number of rooms, cost and building materials used. The only study on the relationship between the prevalence of ECC and waste management modalities at the household showed no statistically significant association. Five studies identified a relationship between urbanization and ECC (urbanization, size, and remoteness of the residential) with results suggesting that there was no significant link between ECC and urbanization in high-income countries contrary to observations in low and middle-income countries. No study assessed the relationship between living in slums, natural disasters and ECC. We identified links between ECC and SDG11.1 and SDG 11.3. The analysis of the findings suggests a plausible link between ECC and SDG11C (Supporting least developed countries to build resilient buildings). Conclusion: There are few studies identifying links between ECC and SDG11, with the findings suggesting the possible differences in the impact of urbanization on ECC by country income-level and home ownership as a protective factor from ECC. Further research is needed to explore measures of sustainable cities and their links with ECC within the context of the SDG11. © The Author(s) 2024."

They are based on a holistic approach that aims to both improve people’s quality of life and ensure environmental sustainability. The weighting of numerous tangible and intangible criteria used in the performance evaluation of these cities has emerged as an important problem. The symmetrical representation of vague and imprecise data using fuzzy set theory is an absolute necessity for a successful weighting process. In this study, symmetrical representation of especially intangible criteria is carried out with proportional spherical fuzzy sets. Proportional spherical fuzzy sets provide significant convenience to the expert in determining the membership, non-membership and hesitancy degrees and ensure that the assigned values are more accurate and consistent. In the study, five main human centric and sustainable city (HCSC) criteria and 26 HCSC sub-criteria determined from the literature were weighted. In addition, criteria weights were obtained by classical spherical fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) for comparison purpose. The first four most important HCSC criteria were determined as water management and conservation, employment/unemployment rate, carbon emission reduction strategies and economic sustainability, respectively. © 2025 by the authors."

While much research has originated from large urban areas in temperate regions, medium-sized boreal cities remain relatively understudied. By following a citywide survey approach, we studied the impact of urbanization intensity gradient resolution on bird diversity in Lahti, Finland, a green boreal city. While one of the urbanization intensity gradients (four-category gradient) showed no significant differences in species richness, the more detailed resolution (ten-category gradient) revealed a decline in species richness within the most urbanized categories, albeit such decline was not pronounced, probably due to the extensive green cover of the city. Species identity analyses confirmed distinct bird community compositions at 50% built cover threshold for both gradient resolutions. Our analyses identified key variables related to bird species richness on the site level, highlighting the positive correlation with tree cover and negative correlations between built cover and noise level with recorded bird species richness. These findings expose the intricate interplay of habitat variables in shaping bird diversity in urban environments. Moreover, the results of this study emphasize the importance of detailed resolutions when assessing urbanization gradients, particularly in less biodiverse regions. Finally, we show the pivotal role of citywide surveys in providing a comprehensive understanding of urban biodiversity, allowing for precise categorization and comparison of conditions within the city. This approach provides valuable insights for urban planning and conservation efforts in boreal climatic regions. © The Author(s) 2025."

The current business model is traditional, that is, the public sector exclusively purchases electricity from distribution companies at fixed rates. However, the electric sector business model has become outdated by the development of renewable distributed generation sources, energy storage systems, and competitive retail electricity markets. In this context of grid-edge technologies, where decarbonization, digitalization, and decentralization urgently promote energy transition, big data analytics applied to the BDGD can be useful for proposing more advanced business models for the public sector, focusing on enhancing electricity affordability, efficiency, and government sustainability. Therefore, this study contributes to an innovative framework called BDA4ES (Big Data Analytics for Energy Sustainability) by (i) creating a methodology that enables researchers to access the BDGD, process the data, and add complementary data, and (ii) conducting a thorough evaluation of investment opportunities in photovoltaic (PV) generation to make the Brazilian public sector more sustainable (financial, social, and environmental). Preliminary results demonstrate that by investing in PV generation, the Brazilian public sector could save R$ 476 billion (US$ 95 billion) over 25 years, representing a return on investment of 366 %, thus avoiding 46.2 Mt CO2-eq of global warming potential (GWP), representing 3.4 % per year of the annual Brazilian carbon footprint on electricity generation. Moreover, when assuming an interest rate of 4.4 % (2019 average Brazilian basic interest rate – SELIC) the discounted payback time is 6.3 years (again, between 1 and 2 political mandate of 4 years), and the Net Present Value (NPV) is R$ 233 billion (US$46.5 billion) over 25 years. From this perspective, considering the overall socieconomical, environmental and political benefits, it becomes evident the public sector energy sustainability project's potential. The conventional optimized tariff model (TAROT) indicates that such a project would imply regulatory tariff increases up to 2.52 %, which is not particularly worrisome. Therefore, the results demonstrate the economic, social, and environmental viability of deploying PV systems to supply green electricity to the public sector, thereby enabling sustainable cities. Although the analyses focused on the public sector and PV generation, the proposed methodology can be used to conduct several distinct studies on energy sustainability for corporate and government social responsibility. © 2025 International Energy Initiative"

Compared to other social sciences, archaeological approaches add rigour to envisioning urban sustainability over several centuries and millennia. The archaeology of the pre-Columbian Lowland Maya urban tradition is an interesting case because data have been used to support conflicting arguments about Maya urban sustainability. We suggest that these contradictions can be partly explained by: (1) sustainability being ambiguously defined, (2) subsets of the urban system being expected to indicate the behaviour of other subsets or of the entire system, and (3) processes being evaluated using different timescales. Drawing on 1500 years of urban history at Tikal, this paper examines how archaeological perspectives add depth of reflection and unfold critical assumptions of the meaning of ‘long-term’ and ‘sustainability’ concealed in self-explanatory notions. We outline the development and longevity of urban settlement at Tikal and analyse the blue-black-green (water, soil, vegetation) infrastructures that sustained urban metabolism and sponsored basic urban functions. Our analyses contribute new insights on the challenges associated with future sustainability transitions over varying temporal scales. The diversity of past and present urban systems and infrastructural initiatives cannot be fitted within a single narrative of urban sustainability, however, and much research is required to examine how blue-black-green infrastructures can support transformative change of aggregated human population zones struggling with potable water scarcity, soil degradation, and habitat and biodiversity loss. © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2024."

While theoretical models are well-recognized among policymakers, the extent to which these approaches are understood and embraced by urban residents remains underexplored. Using a quantitative approach, specifically second-order confirmatory factor analysis (Second-Order CFA), this study examined whether the eco-city concept applied by professionals in Khon Kaen, a city located in northeastern Thailand, aligns with residents’ perceptions. A total of 400 residents and stakeholders in Khon Kaen were surveyed using a structured questionnaire. The analysis of urban residents’ perceptions reveals that the economic aspect exerts the most influence on the eco-city concept, followed by environmental and sociocultural aspects. This finding suggests that residents’ perspectives on eco-cities are generally consistent with professional ideas and theoretical models. However, the contribution of latent factors—economic, sociocultural, and environmental—is shaped by complex interactions among the observed factors. The results indicate that transforming the existing economic and environmental structures of the city is challenging, while the sociocultural aspect, from residents’ perspectives, may be more easily addressed. This study recommends prioritizing the retrofitting of social infrastructure and recognizing its contributions to improving both the economy and environment in urban planning.

Yet little scholarly attention is given to the long-term processes by which cities incrementally develop their local notions of urban sustainability policy (USP) and how these change over time and across diverse initiatives and stakeholders. Our study fills that gap by combining the frameworks of performativity and co-production to analyze the “glocal” formation of USP in Tel Aviv over two decades. We relate this process to strategic planning and trace its evolution from the preparation of the city's first strategic plan in 2000, which introduced sustainability as a vague concept; through the actions of municipal “middle-out” agents, who leveraged performative opportunities to co-produce shared understandings of sustainability and implement programs for sustainable neighborhoods and urban nature; leading to a revised strategic plan with sustainability as its cornerstone, reframed through global urban networks such as C40 Cities. Based on interviews and analysis of interrelated case studies, we provide a fine-grained picture of Tel Aviv's USP formation and outline a conceptual model of “performative co-production” that could be applied to other cities worldwide to specify and evaluate how they create their variants of USP. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

The system consists of three components: the mechanical subsystem, the electrical subsystem, and the control subsystem. The mechanical subsystem, utilising a coil spring booster (CSB), effectively stores braking energy as elastic potential energy, enhancing the flexibility of the braking system. The electrical subsystem converts braking energy into electrical energy. The control subsystem ensures cooperative operation among the mechanical subsystem, the electrical subsystem, and traditional friction braking methods. The study focuses on the characteristics and design process of coil springs, showing that braking force significantly impacts braking efficiency and energy recovery. Finite element analysis demonstrates the working mode of the coil spring in auxiliary braking. Furthermore, the tests conducted on a prototype analysed the energy storage characteristics of the coil spring, revealing the influence of mechanical properties, supporting connection strength, and the number of coil springs. Overall, the proposed SC-RBS utilising the CSB enables efficient utilisation of tram regenerative braking energy, contributing to the development of sustainable cities. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

This strains vital water and energy resources, especially in the face of the worsening challenges of climate change and population growth. A novel method is presented that integrates micro-hydropower plants, with pumps as turbines (PATs), in the water network in the city of Funchal. Sensitivity analyses evaluated the microgrid’s response to variations in the cost of energy components, showing favorable outcomes with positive net present value (NPV). PV solar and micro-wind turbines installed exclusively at the selected PRV sites within the Funchal hydro grid generate a combined 153 and 55 MWh/year, respectively, supplementing the 406 MWh/year generated by PATs. It should be noted that PATs consistently have the lowest cost of electricity (LCOE), confirming their economic viability and efficiency across different scenarios, even after accounting for reductions in alternative energy sources and grid infrastructure costs. © 2024 by the authors."

This paper explores the synergies between Building Information Modelling (BIM) visualisation and Lean construction practices to enhance Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry performance. A structured questionnaire was distributed among BIM and lean experts and analysed by SPSS. The study uses descriptive and correlation analyses to assess ten key lean practices, revealing high industry adoption and favorable mean scores. Notably, BIM-enhanced clash detection and coordination lead with a score of 4.4 out of 5. Correlation analysis establishes significant positive associations between BIM visualisation and practices such as just-in-time production, value stream mapping, lean pull systems, work sequencing, standardised work, and continuous improvement. The findings accentuate the pivotal role of BIM in optimising lean practices, offering valuable insights for practitioners seeking to elevate AEC industry performance through strategic integration. Future studies endeavors are recommended to investigate several alternative avenues to enhance the integration between BIM and Lean practices in the AEC industry. Furthermore, the forthcoming researchers are advised to validate the proposed framework. © 2024, American Scientific Publishing Group (ASPG). All rights reserved."

Today, this transportation industry (i.e., freight and passenger) is among the significant contributors to greenhouse gas emissions in Turkey's megacities. Moreover, 65.43% of short-distance trips between home to work and home to school have been made by private automobiles in Istanbul and increasing concerns about environmental pollution have led practitioners to seek practical, robust, and effective solutions to reduce GHG emissions. Shared electric scooters have rapidly become popular for end-users and practitioners in megacities, depending on their valuable advantages. However, the rapid spread of micro-mobility, characterized by e-scooters, has also raised questions about this system's sustainability, suitability, and applicability. Thus, there are some critical and noteworthy gaps in this issue. This study investigates the factors affecting the suitable e-scooter selection for a sustainable urban transport system. Besides, it aims to develop a methodological framework for assessing the available e-scooter alternatives. For this purpose, a novel negotiation approach, a new form of the Delphi technique, was developed with the help of Fermatean fuzzy sets to identify the influential criteria. Also, the current paper presents a consensus-based MULTIMOORA (Multiple Objective Optimization on the basis of Ratio Analysis plus Full Multiplicative Form) decision-making model based on Fermatean fuzzy sets to address the appraisal problem concerning e-scooter selection. The current paper indicated that economic measures such as acquisition price and upkeep costs affect the e-scooter selection processes. In addition, an optimization model based on cross-entropy and dispersion measures is utilized to compute criteria weights. It highlighted that the costs of e-scooters are still high, and operators consider these criteria instead of the technical and operational features of the e-scooters. Finally, the validity check executed to test the robustness and trustworthiness of the model affirms the model's firmness and trustworthiness. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

We analyzed 37 cities in Poland with populations over 100,000. Research indicates that wind farms located 30–80 km from large cities perform best in terms of generating capacity, while greater distances increase transmission costs and energy losses. In Poland, wind farms are primarily situated in the northwestern regions, posing challenges for energy transmission to the southern cities, which are the main centers of energy consumption. The findings show that wind farms with the highest generating capacity are generally about 50 km from major cities. Key factors influencing wind farm locations include technical criteria, economic feasibility, environmental impact, public opinion, and the availability of transmission networks. Sustainable development of wind farms requires strategic cooperation between urban and rural municipalities, joint spatial planning, coordinated land acquisition, and the exchange of know-how. © 2024 by the authors."

This study traces the impacts of urbanization, innovation, income, and energy consumption on CE for the G7 countries from 1995 to 2019. The time period is important due to the rapid increase in urbanization, globalization, and, at the same time, technology diffusion. The study is focused on novel and relevant panel data econometric methods that tackle cross-section dependence, non-normality of data, and heterogeneity in slope coefficients. The empirical outcome first confirms the long-run cointegrating relationship among the variables in the presence of structural breaks by employing the advanced panel cointegration test. Technologies related to environmental management and energy consumption are positively linked with CE. However, the role of income per capita is found to be inverse with CE. In contrast, the effect of urbanization in different models is mixed for CE. Innovation and its interaction with urbanization are crucial for limiting CE and promoting sustainable cities in G7 economies. This indicates that urbanization with environment-friendly innovation can help G7 countries foster sustainable cities and achieve COP27 targets in general, specifically the Sustainable Development Goal of sustainable cities. The results were tested for the multiplicative effect of different variables with urbanization and innovation. Regarding policy insights, the study recommends focusing on smart and sustainable cities with environment-related innovations and transitioning towards cleaner energy from conventional energy consumption. © 2023 Elsevier B.V."

As a result of continuous urbanization in developing countries, access to urban green spaces (UGS) is continuously decreasing, affecting urban settlers' quality of life as UGS provides a wide variety of ecosystem services such as mitigation of climate change effects and as recreational sites for human wellbeing. An example of megacities undergoing the impact of urbanization is Metropolitan Manila, the National Capital Region of the Philippines. To determine the spatiotemporal changes in a megacity, satellite images from USGS Landsat 5 and 8 ranging from 2005, 2010, 2015, 2020, to 2023 were analyzed using ArcMap 10.8. The remotely sensed images were preprocessed using atmospheric corrections, ensuring the quality of the images. Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) maps of the cities were used to quantify the vegetation in the urban areas. They were calculated using landscape metrics, which were assessed for accuracy using the Kappa Coefficient. A drastic decrease in UGS was detected in almost two decades (2005–2023) as urban expansion occurred in the area. In addition, the UGS area was used to calculate the UGS per Capita, using the total population census per city. Concerning the recommended UGS per Capita from the World Health Organization in urban areas, all the cities were below the recommended index value, thus having unequal access to UGS quantitatively and qualitatively. As the population increases throughout the years, UGS per capita decreases in all 17 cities. This phenomenon in megacities emphasizes the need for prioritizing further establishment, management, and protection of the remaining UGS in the megacity, giving importance to future urban planning and policy-making for a more sustainable future of urban areas, most especially for the welfare and betterment of the state in developing countries. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024."

While these spaces are increasingly recognised as valuable ecological and environmental assets, the state of urban green infrastructure in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) cities is concerning. Rapid urbanisation, weak enforcement of development controls, and informal settlements have reduced the availability of green infrastructure, which has implications on the sustainability of African cities. This paper provides a review of the state and challenges associated with urban green infrastructure in SSA, focusing on the loss of green spaces, urban planning challenges, and the need for policy and citizen action. Drawing on extensive literature (secondary data), the paper highlights the importance of integrating greeneries into the urban fabric of SSA cities to promote resilience to climate change and enhance environmental sustainability. It argues that concrete steps are needed at all levels of society - from policymakers to citizens - to ensure that SSA cities can regain their status as garden cities and promote a healthier, and more resilient ecological landscape. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

Given that cardiometabolic diseases are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in people living in urban areas, transforming cities and urban provisioning systems (or urban systems) toward health, equity, and economic productivity can enable the dual attainment of climate and health goals. Seven urban provisioning systems that provide food, energy, mobility-connectivity, housing, green infrastructure, water management, and waste management lie at the core of human health, well-being, and sustainability. These provisioning systems transcend city boundaries (eg, demand for food, water, or energy is met by transboundary supply); thus, transforming the entire system is a larger construct than local urban environments. Poorly designed urban provisioning systems are starkly evident worldwide, resulting in unprecedented exposures to adverse cardiometabolic risk factors, including limited physical activity, lack of access to heart-healthy diets, and reduced access to greenery and beneficial social interactions. Transforming urban systems with a cardiometabolic health-first approach could be accomplished through integrated spatial planning, along with addressing current gaps in key urban provisioning systems. Such an approach will help mitigate undesirable environmental exposures and improve cardiovascular and metabolic health while improving planetary health. The purposes of this American Heart Association policy statement are to present a conceptual framework, summarize the evidence base, and outline policy principles for transforming key urban provisioning systems to heart-health and sustainability outcomes. © 2024 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Yet there remains limited critical work that interrogates the colonial underpinnings, violent outcomes, and negotiations of beauty politics in urban beautification programs. In our article, we approach urban beautification campaigns in downtown Kampala, Uganda via an explicitly African, and Black feminist analytic of beauty. Specifically, we center the experiences of women market vendors as they navigate city greening initiatives and development plans which promise to ‘transform’ Kampala and re-brand it once again as the ‘Garden City of Africa’. We argue that pairing urban beautification and Black and African scholarship around beauty offers generative insights as it understands such spatial programs as always embodied, contested, and inseparable from intersectional power hierarchies. In turn, we take seriously and carefully examine discourses around beautification: by tracing its colonial and gendered foundations and its visceral impacts as it is internalized and renegotiated by low-income women operating in downtown markets in Kampala. As such, our focus on beauty situates beautification as a disciplining and displacing practice and as mentally and physically violent.

The concept interlinks different domains of urban development, such as spatial planning, transport, water and sanitation services, urban greenery, renewable energy, sustainable building construction, and socioeconomic growth through green solutions. Energy planning and management play a vital role in transforming urban areas into environmentally sustainable cities. Integrating energy management as a key aspect of green city strategies from the pre-planning to post-implementation stages can expedite the process. This paper attempts to comprehend the intertwined role of energy management in green city planning through a comprehensive literature review. Relevant articles that discuss energy and management in interdisciplinary domains under the green city concept were identified and reviewed for the period—2000–2021. Diverse energy-efficient management measures and techniques are reviewed under seven domains of green city planning: green spatial planning, transportation, public infrastructure, urban agriculture, buildings, energy, and growth. The summarized literature emphasizes the relevance and significance of efficient energy management in the transition toward a green city. The study also discusses the need for a gradual transition and the challenges in successfully implementing and managing sustainable strategies. The successful implementation of climatic and environmental solutions through policy-level strategic interventions demands continuous effort and monitoring to achieve the long-term goal of sustainability. Energy-efficient urban development practices, with the foundation of a policy framework, can act as sustainable solutions to maintain the synergy between energy independence and urban development. Expediting the transformation of green cities with the adoption of energy-efficient strategies and renewables to decarbonize the energy supply is an accomplishable vision for every city. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024."

Despite being promoted as 'eco-cities' and 'green cities', these mega-projects often fall short of these ideals, revealing a significant gap between their marketed image and their actual environmental practices (Ouis 2011). Through the lens of Practice Theory enriched by the developmental state model, this study analyses the alignment between the promotional rhetoric of Chinese-backed green city projects and their real-world execution. Practice Theory offers a valuable tool for identifying inconsistencies between stated commitments to sustainability and the tangible outcomes observed in Chinese-finance development projects in Southeast Asia. The developmental state model helps to understand the practices that are translated, transplanted, and embedded by Chinese developers across borders. This analytical framework is critical as it sheds light on the underlying dynamics of 'global China' initiatives, which have gained increased global attention. Such scrutiny is particularly pertinent in highlighting the contrast between the marketed sustainability of these cities and the principles of genuine sustainable development. This critique provides a deeper understanding of the environmental implications of China's overseas investments. Based on this analysis, the overarching research question is: why do Chinese-backed green city projects, such as Forest City in Iskandar Malaysia, frequently exhibit discrepancies between their promoted environmental sustainability and the actual environmental outcomes?  © Elisabetta Nadalutti, 2024."

Therefore, the estimation of electrical energy demand is crucial for the planning of electricity generation and consumption in cities. This study proposes a hybrid deep learning model that combines convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) techniques, both of which are deep learning techniques, to estimate electrical load demand. A hybrid deep learning model and LSTM model were applied to a dataset containing hourly electricity consumption and meteorological information of a city in Türkiye from 2017 to 2021. The results were evaluated using mean absolute percent error (MAPE), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R2) metrics. The proposed CNN-LSTM hybrid model was compared to the LSTM model, with lower MAPE, MAE, and RMSE values. Furthermore, the CNN-LSTM model exhibited superior prediction performance with an R2 value of 0.8599 compared to the LSTM model with an R2 value of 0.8086. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed deep learning model in accurately estimating future electrical load demand to plan electricity generation for sustainable cities. © 2024 by the authors."

Therefore, many governments have undertaken significant changes in the policies applied to developing regions and cities. These new concepts are aimed at gradually building sustainable and smart cities. This is the response of countries to new challenges such as the digital environment, combating climate change, and maintaining favorable living conditions due to the strong environmental and socio-economic degradation. In this regard, the authors set as their main research objective to analyze and assess the sustainability of cities and the surrounding territory by implementing sustainable development policies at all levels. A major task and difficulty for the authors is to build upon and refine a model that can be used to assess sustainable and smart cities. In this paper, the authors propose an approach to studying sustainable cities, thus evaluating the effects of policies implemented in this field. The model includes the main groups of indicators that are used to analyze the sustainable and smart development of municipalities in the Northeast region of Bulgaria. Based on these indicators, data is collected, and processed, and comparative and statistical analysis is carried out to assess their sustainability and intelligence. The authors reach important conclusions such as an unsatisfactory level of sustainable and intelligent development, although the environment and conditions at the national level are favorable. In fact, in Bulgaria, based on the assessment of the studied municipalities in the Northeast region, it is clear that we cannot talk about sustainable cities because Bulgarian municipalities are still at the beginning of this development path. © 2024 Mykolo Romerio Universitetas.

This integrated plant utilizes various subsystems; solar power system, biomass energy system, steam Rankine cycle (SRC), Brayton cycle (BC), organic Rankine cycle (ORC), double-effect absorption system (DEAS), reverse osmosis system, and sonohydrogen production unit. The specific energetic, exergetic, economic and environmental impact assessment studies are carried out to evaluate the system's performance and sustainability. The engineering equation solver (EES) is used for these studies. The energy efficiencies for the BC, ORC and SRC are recorded as 29.69 %, 10.49 %, and 30 %, respectively. In regard to exergy efficiency, the BC, ORC and SRC achieve the following: 46.74 %, 62.73 %, and 53.43 %, respectively. Furthermore, the DEAS attains energetic and exergetic COPs of 1.67 and 0.65, respectively. Additionally, the overall system's energy and exergy efficiencies are found to be 37.68 % and 71.25 %, respectively. The results from the thermal energy storage system indicate that the heat production begins at 7:00 a.m., and the charging of the storage unit commences two hours after and continues until 5:00 p.m., in coinciding with the availability of sunlight. The economic analysis demonstrates that with an initial investment of $53.80 million, the integrated multigeneration system achieves a net present value ranging from $6.87 million to $173.4 million across different hydrogen selling prices, from $7000 to $13,000 per ton up to 2054. © 2024 The Author(s)"

However, most of the existing scheduling models fail to comprehensively account for the requirements of urban development, as exemplified by the vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW), which merely specifies the minimization of path length. This paper introduces a new model of the heterogeneous green city vehicle routing problem with time windows (HGCVRPTW), addressing challenges in urban logistics. The HGCVRPTW model considers carriers with diverse attributes, recipients with varying tolerance for delays, and fluctuating road congestion levels impacting carbon emissions. To better deal with the HGCVRPTW, an adaptive multi-objective genetic algorithm based on the greedy initialization strategy (AMoGA-GIS) is proposed, which includes the following three advantages. Firstly, considering the impact of initial information on the search process, a greedy initialization strategy (GIS) is proposed to guide the overall evolution during the initialization phase. Secondly, the adaptive multiple mutation operators (AMMO) are introduced to improve the diversity of the population at different evolutionary stages according to their success rate of mutation. Moreover, we built a more tailored testing dataset that better aligns with the challenges faced by the HGCVRPTW. Our extensive experiments affirm the competitive performance of the AMoGA-GIS by comparing it with other state-of-the-art algorithms and prove that the GIS and AMMO play a pivotal role in advancing algorithmic capabilities tailored to the HGCVRPTW. © 2024 by the authors."

Many emerging enterprises have grown rapidly under the influence of climate finance policies, contributing to urban low-carbon transition. Therefore, it is important to explore the interrelationships between climate finance, enterprise low-carbon transformations, and urban carbon emission efficiency. This study delves into the impact of climate finance on urban carbon emission efficiency and its underlying transmission mechanisms, drawing upon comprehensive panel data of 262 Chinese cities and 4125 enterprises from 2009 to 2019. The findings indicate that urban climate finance have significantly positive influences on urban carbon emission efficiency and unveil that enterprise environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance exhibits positive influences on urban carbon emission efficiency, underscoring the critical role of enterprises as the vanguard of climate finance. Moreover, the research presents the mediating effect of enterprise green innovation between the urban climate finance and carbon emission efficiency. The mediating effect manifests distinct threshold effects among different levels of enterprise green innovation. Our results suggest that China should enact tailored climate finance policies for higher urban emission efficiency, including judicious allocation of climate funds and effective guidance on enterprise-driven green technological innovation. © 2024 The Authors"

These global crises are partly caused by major land-use change arising from deforestation and agriculture, and are exacerbated by the high demand for resource-intensive foods from populations in the Global North, which are increasingly concentrated in urban centres. The demand by urban populations on the food system has stimulated research on developing sustainable and healthy sources of food within cities. However, debates largely focus on typically treeless urban agriculture and tech-food approaches. This bias neglects the pivotal role of trees and shrubs for ecological and cultural ecosystem service provision, and thus the multifunctional potential of foraging “wild” foods or “semi-wild” cultivation such as in designed food forests in or near cities. In a wide, emerging, and multidisciplinary research field, the actual or potential contribution of urban woodlands to food security and other societal needs such as carbon sequestration and habitat provision often remains taken-for-granted, implicit, or ambiguous. To evaluate the extent to which urban food forestry in the Global North may generate socio-ecological win-win outcomes for climate, biodiversity and society, we review evidence from natural and social sciences along four analytic dimensions: (1) climate change, (2) biodiversity, (3) food production, and (4) relational aspects. Our findings demonstrate the multifactorial benefits of urban foraging and food forestry, but also flag potential risks and disservices ascertained in the literature. We use the synthesised evidence along these dimensions to identify existing gaps and future research directions for optimising socio-environmental benefits. We conclude that much is to be gained from upscaling spaces “where the wild things are” but that requires certain systemic changes to be taken seriously. © 2024 The Authors"

While current urban farming practice tends to play a remedial role in our urban design processes and strategies, it is time for a paradigm shift between cities and the organic worlds that sustain them. Meanwhile, emerging eco-cities, such as the Masdar City project, were devised with ecological mechanisms almost exclusively driven by economic imperatives of the dominating political power. As posited by Federico Cugurullo, this kind of ecological modernization “does not change the traditional capitalistic patterns of production and consumption, and thus replicates the same environmental issues intrinsic to capitalism” (2016). This design research experiments ethnographic method in Toledo, Ohio, to generate urban farming prototypes as localized cultural practice. In response to the “Impossible Dream,” a new urban design initiative of the African American Legacy Project of Northwest Ohio, visual narratives of urban farming urbanism are created to address ecological urbanism and social-economic impacts, as well as building programming and cultural events initiatives, with a focus on public and interactive communal spaces. © 2024, Maggioli S.p.a..

However, how the effective integration of PVNB-generated power into urban energy networks remains a critical area lacking research. To bridge this gap, this study proposes PVNBs-energy storage (ES)-charging station (CS; PVNBs-ES-CS) strategy. It can facilitate the actual consumption of PVNBs power and the mitigation the burden on the grid posed by electric vehicles (EVs) charging demands. The case study conducted in Guangzhou, China, reveals that PVNBs can support up to 5% of the total power demand for EVCSs. Under the PVNBs power maximization consumption scenario, PVNBs can meet up to 30% of the power demands from 60 EVCSs, with 58% of PVNBs generated power being consumed. In the PVNBs-ES-CS future utilization scenario, up to 30% of the power demand of 125 EVCSs can be met, and 36% of the power of PVNBs can be consumed. The combination of PVNBs and EVCSs offers a practical solution for incorporating renewable energy sources into urban energy networks. This application mode can be applied in various cities with EV demands and PVNB power generation data. © 2023"

The use of air conditioners (ACs) has become the most common personal cooling strategy, but further increasing fossil fuel consumption. As sustainable and affordable cooling strategies, urban parks can reduce heat exposure and substitute a part of air conditioners use. This study evaluates the heat exposure reduction from personal cooling to urban parks based on satellite images, questionnaire surveys, and network analysis in Liuzhou, one tropical city in China. We found that residents with lower income had a higher risk of heat exposure. Among the respondents, 85 % of residents chose to use ACs to alleviate high temperatures in summer, and 81.8 % among them were willing to access park cooling area (PCA) to cool off instead of using ACs. About one third parks could serve as potential alternatives (with temperatures <28 °C) to air conditioning, reducing carbon emissions by 175.93 tons per day during the hot summer and offsetting 2.5 % of urban fossil fuel carbon emissions. The design of parks should give more consideration to elder people and provide a good cooling platform for various social income groups. Future planning should also focus on accessibility to enable residents to fully utilize the parks. Building parks within 34.10 ha would provide a more efficient use of land.

Sustainable transportation is perhaps the most challenging element to implement; it must be tailored to the location, size of the development, demographics, and prevalent culture. The literature on the sustainability and effectiveness of transportation aspects of sustainable communities in the Persian Gulf region is limited. To study these aspects in The Sustainable City (TSC), a 46-hectare mixed-use development housing 3,000 people near Dubai, we surveyed city residents and employees on their current travel behaviors and assessed how they respond to the availability of alternative mobility options. We found that, although residents want to live sustainably and actively attempt to do so, their transportation is sustainable only within the city's boundaries. For external trips, less sustainable options such as long-distance air travel, regular commuting to/from Dubai, and even short trips to neighboring communities drive up total transportation emissions. Residents are interested in shared mobility options, and an electric carsharing service could help reduce some travel impacts. However, the suburban setting of the development, fewer alternative mobility options currently available for trips to and from other locations in Dubai, a strong car culture, the lack of connectivity and integration challenges with neighboring communities, and the existing land-use patterns are major barriers to choosing sustainable transportation options. © The Author(s) 2024."

Some empirical studies have tested natural features and perceptual measures respectively, announcing their contribution to psychological restoration. However, inconsistent findings were occasionally reported, whereas few attempts have been made to combine both observed and perceptual factors for validation. Little is known about the variation of restorative drivers and their spatial patterns. To address these problems, this study combined public participation geographic information system (PPGIS) and deep learning method to capture visual qualities of landscape features along with several important perceptual measures. A typical urban park in Wuhan, China, was selected for a pilot study, and 1560 crowdsourced on-site images were collected, with thematic and geographic information being integrated. A series of statistical models, e.g., OLS, QRM, and MGWR, were employed successively for validation. The results showed that landscape preference, place attachment, greenery and water were validated as the global explanatory factors to estimate the conditional mean of psychological restoration. The variation of influential effects of these factors were detected at different restoration levels. There exist spatial heterogeneity for these influential factors on restorative effects. Findings provided new knowledge on a deeper understanding of the subtlety of restoration drivers and their spatial patterns.

Eco-centric approaches like nature-based solutions (NBS) are closely related to sustainability and resilience, offering a more efficient and cost-effective approach to urban development than traditional approaches. The paper explores the concept of NBS, focusing on ecosystem services as a ‘living’ and ‘adaptable’ tool to make cities resilient and sustainable with many regional implementations. It also focuses on the role of NBS in achieving the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The paper critically analyses the five notable NBS projects from different countries (USA, Canada, The Netherlands, China, and Australia) and further addresses the viabilities for NBS intervention in Indian cities. It is observed that the successful adaptation of NBS in urban development necessitates eco-centric policies, collaborative research, adaptive management practices, community engagement, and a strong emphasis on a multi-benefit approach. A proactive focus on ecosystem services is strongly recommended for Indian cities, which includes raising an understanding of the value of nature, introducing NBS at the planning stage, and encouraging investment in ecosystem-based approaches.

Although prior research has offered solutions to mitigate freight-related conflicts in the use of space, a deeper understanding of the extent to which those interventions contribute to cities’ sustainable development goals is needed. This paper presents the results of a meta-analysis that examines the effects of four freight curbside interventions: curbside space allocation for freight, data sharing, parking duration limits, and enforcement. The paper pinpoints benefits and drawbacks of those interventions on last-mile deliveries, the urban environment, and the use of public transport infrastructure. The findings suggest positive impacts and underscore the necessity of incorporating people-centred approaches in the design, implementation, and evaluation of policies concerning public space. Nevertheless, trade-offs when implementing those interventions have been identified. The paper concludes by outlining directions for future research and suggesting implications for urban freight policies. © 2024 The Author(s)"

Vertical farming can be made more sustainable by integrating Internet-of-Things (IoT) and solar photovoltaic (PV) as an intelligent system. This study aims to conduct a feasibility study on using PV cells to reduce energy consumption in IoT-enabled irrigation control and monitoring systems. In the experiment, an intelligent water irrigation system was designed for data collection including energy harvested from PV, climate conditions, and water quality. It was observed that a 45 Watt peak (Wp) solar PV was able to produce up to 460-watt hours of stored electricity in a day which can power a standalone hydroponic system that consists of a 19 W water pump and light emitting diode (LED) grow lights rated at 14 W/m. The climate monitoring system matched meteorological data from online sources proving to be applicable in the prototype. Water conditions such as water temperature and electrical conductivity (EC) also correlate to readings taken from traditional handheld water quality testers. Based on the fabricated prototype, integration is deemed to be feasible using power harvested from the sun. © 2024 by the authors."

A major challenge faced by developing countries is making their cities sustainable by preserving cultural heritage amidst demands for economic growth. This is experienced in the Philippines, with its capital city, Manila, as a case in point. Using a heritage-driven development framework developed by Zerrudo (2020), the paper examines how cultural heritage conservation and tourism development objectives affect the sustainability of cities in developing countries. The paper emphasizes culture as an important pillar of sustainable development. Through online key informant interviews and stakeholder analysis, this qualitative study investigates the tension among stakeholders involved in heritage conservation and tourism development as they push for their divergent interests. The identified conflict stems from the lack of awareness on the part of the stakeholders concerning heritage preservation, which leads to the destruction of built cultural heritage. The findings present that a sustainable urban revitalization program can effectively promote a creative economy that can generate employment opportunities and improve the existing economic conditions, especially for low-income citizens who are part of the city’s humanscape. © 2024 by De La Salle University."

In line to foster decarbonisation in urban areas of tropical countries with decentralised renewable energy technologies, such as small wind turbines in buildings, this research has been carried out. To provide a comprehensive foundation on the topic, urban wind assessment research for various purposes was reviewed, where 48 studies for energy harnessing purposes were classified by country, region and methods. The methodologies are divided into six stages, of which environmental assessment and resilience analysis are scarce. Due to tropical countries being exposed to atmospheric events that historically cause human and material losses, potential future research could be made in line with resilience analysis through metrics that are key to the proper mass deployment of building-integrated wind turbine systems. Of 66 methods for wind prospecting, the most used are on-site measurement, computational fluid dynamics simulation and numerical climate prediction, which represent 49 %, 22 % and 17 %, respectively.

This liberal occupation of urban land undermines the development of the capital and delays the vision of a sustainable city initiated by the public authorities following the Habitat III conference of the United Nations in Quito in 2017. The objective of this article is to show how largely uncontrolled spatial dynamics delay the sustainable development of greater Lomé. To achieve this, this research used quantitative and qualitative approaches based respectively on questionnaire administration and individual interview techniques. In total, 232 landowners and resource persons were interviewed. Field investigations have shown that liberal fixation on land has led to the occupation of unapproved areas and the privatization of administrative reserves. This creates urban instability marked by conflicts between public authorities and populations. This situation, very detrimental to the sustainable city, demonstrates weakened urban governance. © 2024 by the authors."

An opportunity to ensure optimal conditions and quality of life are smart sustainable cities, which integrate various resources for their sustainable development using modern and smart technological solutions. This paper addresses these issues by presenting the results of a study of the level and quality of living conditions in the 29 largest cities in Poland, an EU member state. This study used 35 indicators characterizing the six main areas of activity of the cities to assess the living conditions and quality of life in these cities. To achieve this purpose, an original research methodology was developed, in which the EDAS and WASPAS methods and the Laplace criterion were applied. The application of a multi-criteria approach to the issue under study made it possible to determine the levels of quality of life and living conditions in the studied cities for each dimension, as well as the final index of this assessment (Smart Sustainable Cities Assessment Scores). On this basis, a ranking of these cities was made. In addition, relationships between living conditions and quality of life and the levels of wealth and population of the cities were also assessed. The results showed a wide variation in the levels of living conditions and quality of life in the cities studied, as well as their independence from geographic location. Cities with higher GDP levels that were investing in innovation and knowledge-based development fared much better. © 2024 by the authors."

However, as the relevance, importance and even definition of sustainability is a function of cultural context, planners must take account of local and regional cultural factors in the selection and adaption of digital infrastructures, as well as in the management and encouragement of public acceptance. Achieving this is not a sequential process, but a concurrent one, as these factors are interdependent. This raises the question of what factors affect and mediate the technology, choice, and public acceptance of smart sustainable cities. This paper attempts to address this question by proposing a new model which advances our current, and considerable, understanding of Technology Acceptance Modelling—using an analysis based on Structural Equation Modelling. This new model, called the Culturally Informed Technology Acceptance Model, was validated using data from a survey of residents of a variety of Saudi Arabian cities. The proposed model is designed around important factors that can be influenced by cultural context, such as digital literacy, process improvements, cost savings and privacy, and is a useful tool for understanding the role of culture in the public acceptance of smart sustainable technology. This design focus is for a number of reasons, such as helping development bodies ensure that the technologies used align with the socio-cultural context. It will also help in the management of at-scale technology roll out in a way that is resource-efficient. Although the Culturally Informed Technology Acceptance Model has been developed and validated using data from Saudi Arabia, the authors believe that it could be adapted to meet the needs of countries/cities that are looking to implement smart city strategies matched to their own distinct socio-cultural identity. © 2024 by the author."

The objective of this paper is then to investigate and evaluate the overall system thermodynamically for potential applications. Solar, biomass and wind energy sources are considered in the system development, and the potential needs of the community including electricity, heat, and hot water are fulfilled. A fraction of the renewable solar energy is stored in the form of hydrogen to operate the system during the off-peak time. The stored hydrogen is then employed to operate a proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell, and electrical energy is produced for the charging station. Several sensitivity analyses are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the H2 storage system. The share of H2 power to power (P2P) solution increases from 18.5 % at a photovoltaic (PV) area of 250 m2 to 45.4 % at a PV area of 500 m2. During the charging mode, around 25.5 MWh of excess solar energy is generated from the PV field. The deployment of 500 m2 can generate 769 kg of hydrogen that is stored in the hydrogen storage tank, and it can generate 18.4 MWh of energy from the PEM fuel cell.

This paper firstly analyses the development status quo of low-carbon cities, clarifies the influencing factors of low-carbon eco-cities, and discusses the correlation between the scale, population density, traffic structure and energy development of low-carbon eco-cities and low-carbon eco-cities. On this basis, the low-carbon ecological development strategy of City C in China is proposed as an example. Therefore, this study argues that low-carbon cities, as a strategic goal of new urbanisation development, should focus on constructing a theoretical system of urban upgrading and optimisation under the environment of green and sustainable ecological development, and introduce corresponding construction guarantee optimisation policies. © 2024 IGI Global.

Smart cities require a decentralised and collective energy model in the form of renewable energy communities (RECs). This work aims to propose an economic analysis of residential photovoltaic systems within a REC according to different incentive and market scenarios. For this scope, the Net Present Value (NPV) is used in both baseline and alternative scenarios showing a very good profitability, confirmed by sensitivity, scenario and risk analysis. It is therefore evident how the avoided cost in the bill has a decisive impact on the result and how this is amplified by virtuous behaviour in consumption synchronous to the production phase. Subsequent analyses concern how the profits obtained are divided among the prosumers and it is shown that revenues shared according to a partial energy consumption profile may be the right compromise. In order to consider a more realistic case an additional consumer is analysed within REC. The proposed analyses show interesting policy implications: the subsidies and citizens behaviour are key factors for sustainable cities based on green energy production and consumption. © 2024 The Authors"

In a linear city where firms and residents compete for land, I show that the location patterns of EV users exert significant impact on traffic pollution externalities and urban land rent revenues. In particular, the urban spatial structure with EV users residing in the suburbs (instead of the center) is associated with a better urban environment and higher land rent revenues. From society's point of view, the increased land rents may be levied by governments to subsidize suburban residents in buying EVs or to invest in building charging stations, achieving higher efficiency. © 2024 Elsevier B.V."

Using reference multi-criteria methods, this paper proposes a comprehensive framework to facilitate spatial analyses. The methodology is based on two modified multi-criteria techniques, namely TOPSIS and BIPOLAR, which include reference points for evaluation and rank-ordering objects. In TOPSIS objects are ordered directly concerning distances from the ideal and the anti-ideal points, whereas in BIPOLAR they are compared indirectly utilising two sets of reference objects: desirable (“good”) and undesirable (“bad”). Furthermore, the distinction between internal and external reference points is examined. The motivation behind this study lies in monitoring progress towards achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in different areas while considering objectives set out in the Agenda 2030—a complex plan of transformation for people, planet, peace, and prosperity adopted by United Nations Member States and focused on realizing 17 SDGs and 169 targets integrated into the economic, social, and environmental dimensions. To prove the usability of the proposed framework, we applied it to measure the spatial diversity of EU countries in terms of implementing SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities. The analysis is conducted for the years 2015 and 2019 and is based on eight EU sustainable development indicators. The findings are showcased as rankings and depicted via maps for identifying analogous regions in the EU. The research indicates varying levels of achievement in meeting the SDG 11 objective among EU countries, with northern countries performing significantly better than southern ones. © The Author(s) 2024."

While urban greening efforts have undeniable benefits for human health and the biological communities inhabiting these green zones, disease vector populations may also be affected, possibly promoting greater pathogen transmission and the emergence of infectious diseases such as dengue, West Nile fever, malaria, leishmaniosis and tick-borne diseases. Evidence for the impact of urban green areas on vector-borne disease (VBD) transmission is scarce. Furthermore, because of vast disparities between cities, variation in green landscapes and differing scales of observation, findings are often contradictory; this calls for careful assessment of how urban greening affects VBD risk. Improved understanding of the effect of urban greening on VBDs would support planning, monitoring and management of green spaces in cities to sustainably mitigate VBD risks for surrounding urban populations. © 2024 European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).

Although previous research has examined policy planning and indicator development for a low-carbon transition based on a variety of macropolicies, more research is needed to determine whether such policies can help reduce carbon emissions and accelerate urban transitions. Based on 2015–2021 panel data covering 17 South Korean first-level administrative districts, we employ a propensity score matching-difference in difference (PSM-DID) model and a mediating effect model to address issues of interregional development faults and policy feasibility and to investigate the impacts of the low-carbon green city (LCGC) policy in different regions on urban carbon emissions. To address the development gap and policy feasibility across regions, this study investigates the mechanism and path of the effect of the LCGC policy on urban carbon dioxide emissions in various regions, ultimately incorporating local spatial autocorrelation (LSA) to investigate the characteristics of the differences at the spatial level. The findings demonstrate that (1) the present regulations effectively limit total urban carbon emissions but are characterized by strong rebound elasticity and a short period. (2) Energy use and renewable energy production have the greatest influence on reducing total urban carbon emissions. (3) The local spatial autocorrelation clustering characteristics present the clustering characteristics of being high in the east and low in the north. The HH agglomerations have the largest coverage and are mainly distributed in the southeast and southwest directions of the study area. The results of the study provide a decision-making basis and theoretical support for relevant decision-makers to formulate differentiated carbon emission reduction policies and to eliminate the current transition dilemma with a new research methodology. © 2023 The Author(s)"

Extant literature have highlighted green cities as a major path towards sustainability in the construction industry but very little is known on the socioeconomic aspect of green cities and its bid in promoting sustainability in the construction industry; hence, the premise of this study which highlights the socioeconomic factors affecting green cities development in Ghana. Design/methodology/approach: A comprehensive literature review was conducted to identify the socioeconomic factors affecting green cities. A quantitative research strategy was adopted to collect primary data from respondents who have the requisite understanding and knowledge in green cities using questionnaires. The data gathered was then analysed using descriptive statistics and exploratory factor analysis viz principal component analysis. Findings: The socioeconomic factors affecting green city development comprised: Green support mechanisms (i.e. innovation and technology, green city planning (urban planning), stakeholder engagement, awareness, city planning (transportation) and environmental regulations); green inhibitors (i.e. population, culture, housing and policy implementation); green market and finance (i.e. digital finance, green market mechanism, green investment finance, risks and uncertainties, income levels of clients). It was evident that socioeconomic factors are significant to the development of green cities in Ghana and hence policy makers and various stakeholders should prioritize socioeconomic factors in the bid to achieve sustainability through green cities in the construction industry. Originality/value: This paper presents a foremost and comprehensive study on the socioeconomic factors affecting green cities in Ghana. The study results showed that even though the path to sustainability in green cities has pivoted mainly on environmental factors, socioeconomic factors are also significant to green city development, hence, policy makers and the construction industry should keenly consider the socioeconomic factors affecting green city development in the bid towards sustainability for cities. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited."

A multidimensional approach was adopted, namely 28 subindices characterizing seven dimensions affecting the quality of life in 18 provincial cities in Poland. The developed methodology consisted of two stages. In the first stage, using the indicators, the values of quality-of-life indices for the studied dimensions were determined. In the second stage, using these results, the values of the total quality-of-life indices in the studied cities were measured. Then, rankings for the cities in question were created. In addition, based on the values of the dimension indices and total indices, the levels of quality of life were determined. Relationships between parameters characterizing the sizes of studied cities and their wealth and the determined quality of life were also measured. The Gray Rational Analysis method was used for ranking, and three objective analytical methods were used to determine index weights: Equal weight, Entropy and CRITIC, and the Laplace's criterion. The results indicate that living standards in the studied cities vary widely, both in terms of the value of the total index and the indices of individual dimensions. The best living conditions were found in Warsaw (the capital of Poland), Bialystok and Olsztyn, and the worst in Kielce and Szczecin.  © 2024 Magdalena Tutak, published by Sciendo."

However, there is a need for in-depth comparative research on changing landscape patterns in cities and their effects on the urban thermal environment. This study investigates the spatial arrangement of GS and the influence of impervious surfaces on LST in urban areas, examining their cooling and warming effects in the urban landscapes of Beijing and Islamabad. The study aims to assess the impact of the spatial arrangement of GS on LST using a moving window of 1 km2 to analyze the overall effect of landscape patterns on the urban environment. Using Gaofen (GF–2) and Landsat–8 satellite data, we examined the biophysical surface properties of core urban areas. The results indicate a significant difference in the mean LST of 5.44 °C and 3.31 °C between impervious surfaces and GS in Beijing and Islamabad, respectively. The barren land and GS in Islamabad experience a higher LST of 3.39 °C compared to Beijing, which accounts for 1.39 °C. In Beijing, configuration metrics show no significant effect on urban LST, while edge density (ED) exhibits a slightly negative trend. In contrast, in the city of Islamabad, the landscape shape index (LSI), patch density (PD), and number of patches (NP) metrics have a significant influence on LST. The cooling effect of GS patches (0.1–0.5 ha) is more pronounced, while that of GS patches of 15–20 ha shows no significant effect on LST. The temperature difference (TD) of 5.01 °C was observed from the edge of GS in Beijing and 3.3 °C in Islamabad. Considering Islamabad's lush green scape compared to Beijing, this study suggests that Islamabad may experience an increase in LST in the future due to urbanization. This study's findings may assist urban policy-makers in designing sustainable green city layouts that effectively address future planning considerations. © 2024"

Planning initiatives in cities must include a “ecological city” perspective in order to tackle these urgent problems and combat the global climate disaster. A vital first step in accomplishing this sustainability goal is determining the size and scope of a city’s ecological footprint. The main objective of this study was to calculate the ecological footprints of Sakarya for the years 2010 and 2018. This comprehensive evaluation encompassed a range of key components, including energy consumption from fossil fuels, heating and transportation costs, food consumption patterns, waste generation, recycling rates, and urban land usage. In 2010 and 2018, the total ecological footprints resulting from these variables were 1,125,856 and 1,226,490 global hectares, respectively. Most significant drivers behind the increase in Sakarya’s ecological footprint during this period found were the utilization of fossil fuels and energy consumption. Consequently, our findings underscore the importance of implementing alternative energy sources, such as biofuels and waste-produced energy, alongside adopting alternative transportation methods to reduce the ecological footprint. We also provide insights into the associated costs of these measures and propose innovative solutions to be considered. © The Author(s) 2024."

However, due to the wide range of interpretations and applications associated with sustainable cities, diverse methodologies can yield starkly contrasting results. This paper adopts ecological and low-carbon perspectives to evaluate and discuss urban sustainability. The core of this investigation involves quantitatively measuring a city’s sustainability based on the lifecycle metrics of emergy and carbon footprint. The findings reveal that Yangzhou, recognized as a model ecological city by authorities, exhibits an emergy sustainability index below the standard benchmark (ESI = 0.02 < 1). GIS mapping reveals that the city’s largest ecological service system is situated in the northwest water region. Both the emergy and carbon footprint analyses indicate that urbanized areas exert a detrimental influence on the city’s overall sustainability. Additionally, the administrative authorities in Yangzhou have implemented proactive measures to transition the city towards sustainability. Currently, the impacts of clean energy adoption and urban wetland restoration are particularly pronounced. The application of lifecycle emergy and carbon footprint methods offers a holistic approach for urban managers, enabling sustainable urban planning that harmoniously integrates ecological emergy and low-carbon considerations. This approach is instrumental in the realization of sustainable cities. © 2024 The Author(s).

This study aims to reveal the face of climate policies and the integration of urban adaptation into urban planning policies in the city of N’Djaména. To achieve this, we adopted a methodology combining both quantitative and qualitative approaches. Surveys of key informants were used to gather information on how to achieve the objectives set. The results show that key informants believe that climate policies have not met the expectations of the city’s citizens in terms of effectiveness and positive impacts. These players assume that urban policy planning does not take urban adaptation into account. The four categories of barriers hindering the integration of urban adaptation and its implementation relate to a lack of information and knowledge, political ill will, and organization and constraints linked to the mobilization and availability of resources. This study suggests the sharing of information, knowledge, and communication involving all stakeholders in N’Djaména’s urban development, the organization of the city’s state and municipal structures, the involvement and support of political authorities, greater access to financing, and the establishment of professional networks of expertise as catalysts for success. © 2024 by the authors."

Intervening in the context where reflexive planning and design methodologies are deployed to implement urban regeneration through public engagement (what I call “designerly intervention”), this paper investigates what type of collectivity is constituted as infrastructural publics by designerly interventions and what forms of rights they can have. Drawing on ethnographic accounts of urban regeneration in Seoul, it shows how designerly interventions mobilize residents as possessing a novel form of expertise, as “resident-experts” who can design a sustainable city, problematizing the renewal of the worn-out infrastructure as how to stimulate the resilience of a city. This results in an infrastructural connection that focuses on immediate results and the ordinary scale of urban regeneration, which enacts the rights of the public as city-users’ rights, namely not as rights protected by law but as a practical capacity that infrastructural devices in everyday life provide. This paper explores how designerly interventions invoke an experimental approach that opens up the normative questions of public engagement with planning. © The Author(s) 2024."

This research aims to unravel the intricate associations among urban green cover, built-up index, and surface temperature, specifically within the spatial confines of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation. The primary objective is to comprehensively understand how the conversion of green spaces into built-up areas influences land surface temperature and, consequently, the urban heat island effect. Employing a geospatial approach, the study utilizes normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI), normalized differential built-up index (NDBI), and land surface temperature (LST) data extracted from Landsat imagery spanning four temporal points (1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020). The borough-level analysis offers a micro-level perspective within the limited urban space of Kolkata Municipal Corporation. Correlation analyses and scatter diagrams are employed as tools to scrutinize the complex relationships between these variables, providing a robust methodology for the investigation. The research underscores the significant impact of urbanization on the study area, revealing a consistent trend of converting green spaces into built-up areas over the studied decades. This transformation has led to a reduction in green coverage and a concurrent increase in surface temperatures. The study reveals compelling correlations and patterns through NDVI, NDBI, and LST analyses, emphasizing the urgency for serious attention from urban planners, environmentalists, and ecologists.

It has evolved from a simple oasis and ksar (traditional settlement) to a city with a contrasting center and segregated outskirts. This growth has led to significant urban fragmentation that affected residents’ quality of life. This research uses space syntax theory to analyze Bechar’s urban configurations and their impact on functionality and sustainability. The study examines integration, connectivity, control, and intelligibility through axial maps and syntactic measures. Findings reveal that areas with high integration show better accessibility and reduced vehicle reliance, while segregated areas face accessibility challenges and limited services. Global integration values range from −1 to 1.192, averaging at 0.767, which indicates different accessibility among neighborhoods. These insights are crucial to identify areas where sustainable urban planning can mitigate adverse effects and enhance city efficiency. We created an axial map using DepthmapX v0.8.0 software and a modified digital QGIS map to collect data and measure Bechar’s urban properties. The methodology we used translates social behaviors into spatial representations, generating interpretative models for social and spatial phenomena. This article provides valuable information on the infrastructure and service needs, guiding strategic resource allocation. The proposed urban design strategies include urban canopies and optimized building ratios to reduce energy consumption and promote sustainability.

Building on extensive qualitative data from three cities in Europe (Amsterdam, Vienna, Lyon) and four cities in the United States (Washington, Austin, Atlanta, Cleveland), we use thematic analysis and grounded theory to examine the complex relationship between historical environmental and racial injustices and current racial green inequities produced by the green city agenda. Our analysis also offers insights into the main differences in how community members articulate concerns and demands over racial issues related to green gentrification in Europe versus North America. Results show that urban greening—and green gentrification specifically—can create ‘compounded environmental racisms’ by worsening racial environmental injustices and further perpetrating green racialized displacement, re-segregation and exclusion. The latter is produced by the racial inequities embedded in green infrastructure projects and the related unequal access to environmental benefits, affordable housing, political rights and place-making. Moreover, we find that settler colonial practices combined with persisting exposure to toxins and re-segregation in the United States together with neocolonial spatial and social practices in Europe shape how racialized community members perceive and interact with new green amenities. © 2024 The Authors.

This study explores public perceptions of obstacles to Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption in Oman and assesses EVs' impact on city sustainability. Over 300 car consumers in Muscat participated in a survey, facilitated through Microsoft Forms, and distributed via email and social media platforms like WhatsApp, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Instagram. Data analysis utilized descriptive statistics and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). The study finds that the main obstacles to EV adoption in Oman include a lack of public charging infrastructure, limited EV knowledge, and concerns about available EV models. Safety issues, financial constraints, and low public awareness of climate change also hinder adoption. Structural SEM results show positive correlations between cost-effectiveness, charging infrastructure availability, climate change awareness, and intention to adopt EVs. However, safety concerns negatively impact EVs purchase intention. Regarding the impact of EVs on Oman's cities, respondents generally believe in the potential for EVs to improve air quality, enhance urban living conditions, and mitigate noise and air pollution. However, the respondents were also cautious about the widespread use of EVs due to the high infrastructure investment costs and energy consumption. Therefore, this study recommends targeted interventions like awareness campaigns, better charging infrastructure, and adoption incentives. These insights are vital for policymakers and stakeholders aiming to promote sustainable EV adoption in Oman and beyond. Copyright © 2024 Ahmed, Fida, Thumiki and Hamdun Al Marhoobi."

The waste heat from the CAES is recommended to increase the system's overall efficiency. In this regard, an innovative green hybrid multi-generation system based on a CAES is proposed. The organic Rankine cycle ORC and RO desalination system have been used in this system to recover waste heat and supply potable and domestic hot water. A comprehensive analysis of the proposed system includes energy, exergy, economic, exergoeconomic, and advanced exergy analyses. The findings indicate this system can produce 37.48 MWh of electricity, 19.42 kg/s of potable water, and 2.67 kg/s of domestic hot water. Furthermore, with a total profit of $ 24.54 M and a payback period of 3.3 years, this system's energy and exergy round trip efficiencies are 73.54 % and 55.01 %, respectively. According to the advanced exergy analysis of the system, 31.5 % of the total exergy destruction is avoidable. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"

Therefore, the early detection of plant diseases can avoid any losses or damage to these crops. This paper presents an image processing and a deep learning-based automatic approach that classifies the diseases that strike the apple leaves. The proposed system has been tested using over 18,000 images from the Apple Diseases Dataset by PlantVillage, including images of healthy and affected apple leaves. We applied the VGG-16 architecture to a pre-trained unlabeled dataset of plant leave images. Then, we used some other deep learning pre-trained architectures, including Inception-V3, ResNet-50, and VGG-19, to solve the visualization-related problems in computer vision, including object classification. These networks can train the images dataset and compare the achieved results, including accuracy and error rate between those architectures. The preliminary results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Inception V3 and VGG-16 approaches. The obtained results demonstrate that Inception V3 achieves an accuracy of 92.42% with an error rate of 0.3037%, while the VGG-16 network achieves an accuracy of 91.53% with an error rate of 0.4785%. The experiments show that these two deep learning networks can achieve satisfying results under various conditions, including lighting, background scene, camera resolution, size, viewpoint, and scene direction. © 2023 by the authors."

In the last decade, this topic has received significant interest from the scientific community, contributing to publications in different areas. However, the existing literature is fragmented, and efforts have not been made to categorize and analyze it from a freight logistics perspective. This work aims to fill this gap by presenting a systematic literature review (SLR) of the potential impacts of EVs on sustainable road-freight transport operations, including in urban areas. We reviewed 237 peer-reviewed articles for bibliometric and literature classification analysis, whereby 119 articles were subsequently studied for content analysis and research gaps related to sustainability approaches. The bibliometric analysis showed significant growth in the body of research in the past two years, reflected in the number of journal papers, authors, and references. In the literature and keywords analysis, we identified five main categories and research areas: economic and competitive aspects, city logistics, environmental sustainability, vehicle fleet operations, and infrastructure and technology. In addition, this paper revealed eight key research gaps for future research: multimodal integration, long-haul and heavy-duty truck approaches, emerging economies, business models, social factors, charging infrastructure inclusion, and fleet replacement policies. These findings can enlighten researchers and practitioners toward sustainable research and real-life applications of electromobility in freight logistics. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"
"Implementing Smart Sustainable Cities in Saudi Arabia: A Framework for Citizens’ Participation towards SAUDI VISION 2030","2023","10.3390/su15086648","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85156138645&doi=10.3390%2fsu15086648&partnerID=40&md5=f010aed783c0f3818cb5ee68e1ee8bec","Cities in Saudi Arabia need to expand rapidly due to the rapidly growing urban population. To develop smart sustainable cities (SSC), human, social, and environmental capital investments must be expanded beyond just focusing on technology. There have been several cities that have adopted smart city labels as recognition of the advantages of smart cities. Many countries acknowledge the value of citizens’ involvement in public urban planning and decision making, but it is difficult to evaluate their impact and compare it to other factors. This study aims to develop a citizens’ participation framework, identify any additional stakeholder’s management measures (SMM) (in addition to the ones previously developed by the authors), and explain the relationship with citizens’ participation level (CPL) for driving SSC. Three rounds of the Delphi method were conducted to structure and validate the framework by the decision maker in the field of urban planning and reach a consensus of understanding the drivers of SSC. The study group was limited to 25 participants because this study focuses on the perspective of decision makers toward CP. Mean score (MS) ranking and Kendall Coefficient were used to confirm the importance of these additional stakeholders’ management measures. The results suggest three main component structures of the conceptual framework, which are SMM, CPL, and Citizens’ Participation Recruitment (CPR), which are all necessary for smart sustainable city outcomes (SSCO) for achieving the Future Sustainable Cities Plan (FSCP) within the context of Vision 2030 and government policy in Saudi Arabia. Using the proposed framework will enable all the stakeholders to gain a deeper understanding of SSC and their complex natures from a conceptual and practical standpoint. The contribution to knowledge of this study is by developing a conceptual framework that can support the implementation of SSC, and by providing an understanding the CPR standards and the involvement of citizens in urban development, which eliminates any debate regarding SSC. © 2023 by the authors."

Therefore, various mechanical attachments have been designed and fabricated for performance evaluation. Since pump performance and drawdown are inversely related, the primary goal is to reduce drawdown as much as possible. The effect of various types of mechanical attachments on pump performance is investigated in this research work. Three bowl-type mechanical attachments can be integrated at once and can increase efficiency by up to 58%, which is 8% more than utilizing no attachment. Additionally, the impact of bore well diameter on pump performance has been studied. In addition, the impact of applying mechanical attachment at two pumping sites has been investigated, and a considerable amount of energy savings has been found. The response surface methodology (RSM)-based optimization of the various input parameters has also been examined. It was found that the maximum 62.04 % could be achieved through a head of 66.5 m, a discharge of 0.012 m3/s, an input power of 12,605 W, and a bore well diameter of 0.215054 m, having three bowl-type mechanical attachments at a time. The mathematical modeling was also performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and formulated some equations for pumping efficiency with various pumping input parameters. Since there is very little variation between actual and anticipated performance, it can be used to evaluate the pumping system's performance in relation to various input parameters. As a result, maintaining sustainable cities and societies might greatly benefit from the energy-efficient pumping system. © 2023 The Author(s)"

Stakeholders respond to them in various ways for strategizing towards urban sustainability. We refer to this as frameworking, which we identify as focusing on how frameworks are commensurated. However, research on commensuration has concentrated mostly on reactivity towards metrics. Little is known about how stakeholders contemplate the quality of and reaction to rankings and indices. We examine this issue through a configurational analysis of a set of European cities that consistently appear in these frameworks. We unveil several configurations of smart city metrics that relate to sustainability. Based on these effects, we theorize frameworking as differences in the relative configurations of smart city metrics that can generate performance. These configurations relate to three underlying dimensions: smart city capability, reactivity and context. We show that when frameworking is studied configurationally, we can identify the previously under-researched response to the quality of indices and reactivity to metrics. Finally, we discuss the theoretical and practical implications of a complex account of frameworks relevant to boosting urban sustainability. © The Author(s) 2022."

As the role of data-sharing to facilitate systems integration across city sectors for developing smart cities has grown ever so profoundly, there is a need for decentralisation, transparency, and openness in terms of integration of city sectors to have efficient data diffusion among them. This is extremely important as the requirements of smart sustainable cities are open data sharing to allow service providers to better serve the citizens. Blockchain technology offers these characteristics with the extremely important added advantage of maintaining data security via an immutable record. However, the notion of the use of Blockchain for smart sustainable cities is still in the early years and requires extensive efforts to research and test it. In this research, a state-of-the-art review is conducted to explore the usefulness of Blockchain technology in smart sustainable city development with a specific focus on cross-sectoral systems integration, highlighting the gaps in the existing body of knowledge. This leads to the proposal of a novel framework for the use of Blockchain for smart sustainable cities, linking together service providers and citizens. © 2023 The Authors.

Moreover, according to scholars, a smart city is also sustainable city. Nonetheless, the environmental aspects of urban sustainability are often de-emphasized in favor of discourses around the technical characteristics of SC technologies. In order to integrate the two, the article introduces the notion of a smart green city (SGC) in which technological means and environmental outcomes are in sustainable balance. SGC is presented here as a unifying concept integrating smart city and green city concepts through the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) framework. To illustrate the positive synergy between a city's greenness and smartness, we derive operational definitions of both based on the online media's attention to the related technology and sustainability initiatives. After calculating the two indices for all the cities worldwide with over one million inhabitants (498 cities), regression analysis is performed to determine the strength and direction of the relationships between a city's greenness and smartness. We find that a city's greenness is positively related to its smartness. Principal component analysis reveals a potential relationship between a city's population and the two indices. In particular, a large city's population negatively affects its greenness but positively affects its smartness. A joint index of smartness and greenness is negatively related to a city's population. Hence, the containment of uncontrolled urban growth is critical for successfully implementing SGC initiatives. The analysis results are of use to policy-makers, city managers, and planners intending to integrate the ESG framework into their future urban development strategies. Moreover, to our knowledge, a joint evaluation of a city's greenness and smartness has never been performed before on the inter-regional level of analysis. Accordingly, such a holistic assessment can be of methodological interest to scholars of smart and sustainable cities. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"

However, as urban sprawl intensifies, socioeconomic disparities widen, and populations burgeon, the concepts of green fairness and environmental justice confront substantial hurdles. The daily exposure to greenery emerges as a crucial determinant of these factors, yet no comprehensive methodologies currently exist to gauge the levels of daily accessible urban greenery or to probe the distribution of green inequities. In this research, we harness the capabilities of Spatial Design Network Analysis (sDNA) to scrutinize spatial choice and integration, using the metropolis of Chengdu as a case study. Three indicators representing daily accessed urban greenery are utilized, including the Green View Index (GVI) at the street level, the assessment of green spaces based on the Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI), and the level of greenery within the visible range of buildings. Green Accessibility Index (GAI) was further proposed and calculated for three states of commuting, recreation, and work to synthesize the accessibility and greenness levels. The distribution of green unfairness in the study area are evaluated using bivariate local spatial autocorrelation. Our findings reveal that (1) frequent expressway commuting and existing greenery does not satisfy urban fairness needs. (2) Significant differences in unfair areas of building visible greenery (3) Unfair areas are concentrated in high-income neighborhoods (4) Severe unfairness between greenery and population in large cities, where most people do not enjoy the benefits of adequate greenery. We provide recommendations based on these findings, thereby offering actionable insights to optimize the spatial distribution of green unfairness through enhanced accessibility of urban greenery. © 2023 The Author(s).

Research evidence on this multidisciplinary topic tends to be fragmented, hindering constructive analysis of its role in shaping sustainable cities. This paper addresses this by undertaking a holistic systematic review to consolidate diverse perspectives. The analysis of 195 reviewed papers identified four main clusters of knowledge that include methodological approaches, policy instruments, urban design elements, and impacts of interventions. The analysis revealed that a growing body of literature is increasingly focused on improving accessibility planning, transit-oriented development, and policy integration to achieve sustainable and healthy transport as a vital element of resilience in cities. The review found, however, that the integration of environment and energy into land use and transport models is still at a nascent stage of development and has largely been overlooked in traditional LUTI models. This can lead to unreliable assessments of the impacts of low-carbon mobility solutions, emerging green transport technologies, and long-term changes in energy consumption affecting sustainable mobility futures. This paper concludes by connecting LUTEI dimensions to the UN’s sustainable development goals (SDG), outlining future directions to ignite meaningful research on the topic and providing a transparent path for decision-makers to adopt LUTEI-informed planning. © 2023 by the authors."

In a time when the demand for electricity is escalating due to factors like taxes and urban expansion, it is imperative to explore strategies to cut costs. One pivotal area is public lighting management. Presently, governments are transitioning from sodium vapor lighting to LED lamps, which already contributes to decreasing consumption. In this scenario, computer vision systems, particularly using YOLO, have the potential to further reduce consumption by adjusting the power of LED lamps based on pedestrian traffic. Additionally, this paper employs fuzzy logic to calculate lamp power based on detected pedestrians and ambient lighting, ensuring compliance with the NBR 5101:2018 standard. Tests with public surveillance camera images and simulations validated the proposal. Upon implementing this project in practice, a 45% reduction in public lighting consumption was observed compared to conventional LED lighting. © 2023 by the authors."

There is an irony that informal settlements have more of the ideal attributes of smart development, including mixed-use development, high densities, compact affordable housing, modal accessibility, and dense local employment opportunities, than sprawling, low-density single-use developments in surrounding formal developments. Yet, despite their smart characteristics, these informalised settlements are not regarded as ideal spaces to live in due to their informal nature and thus are regarded as unsustainable modes of living. This study critically investigates these assumptions, analysing how informal mixed-use spaces are produced, organised, and regulated organised outside formal planning in a customary land use management system in Cape Town, South Africa, and whether this mode of urbanism is smart, i.e., sustainable. The research results indicate that customary self-regulation of informal settlements creates very liveable, polymorphic spaces in the marginalised townships despite the severe lack of resources. Its smart characteristics are not for aesthetic reasons but to make space functional and personal for the residents. However, the unregulated nature of this new mode of urbanism also limits the accumulation of wealth within the township, and it creates dangerous and unhealthy living conditions for residents in terms of litter, noise, flooding, fire risks, environmental degradation, and anti-social behaviour, especially in public areas not adequately regulated by customary regulatory bodies. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."

Efforts to promote “healthy cities” continue to garner interest as a means of empowering local communities to improve residents’ access to healthcare and encourage them to adopt more preventative practices. Due to the confluence of urbanization and population aging in China, the country’s cities must be designed and constructed to accommodate a wider range of residents and improve the quality of life for residents of all ages. A policy intervention evaluation model for the sustainable city index system is introduced after briefly reviewing the historical progression of sustainable city construction and the policies around the world. Then, six main pilot cities are selected to analyze their unique characteristics and trends across various dimensions. Finally, the dynamic simulation model is used to simulate the operation status of the pilot city system according to different dynamic factors. Two main conclusions are reached. (1) In different areas, the implementation of the sustainable city pilot strategy has had varying degrees of encouraging effects on building projects. (2) Overall, the pilot cities’ observed value is quite near to the control value calculated here. This suggests the synthetic control unit closely resembles the actual pilot city in terms of layout and design. (3) The healthy city pilot policy has a promotion effect on healthy city construction, as measured by its effect size of 0.015.

Thus, this study explores how SVC contributes to achieving the SDGs at the city level. We performed the Cross-Network Information Analysis protocol, which is properly designed for investigating dyadic phenomena. The main findings revealed that SVC contributes to most SDGs in cities, mainly 11, 17, 9, and 8. Consensus building, smart sustainable cities, and innovation ecosystems are central aspects of the SVC contribution to the SDGs in general. Other relevant aspects are: shared meaning, networking strategy, socio-spatial & cultural patterns, technology, circular economy, sharing economy, corporate social responsibility, entrepreneurship, social bricolage, knowledge sharing, open innovation, ethics, and creativity. However, there has been no empirical evidence of SVC contribution to reaching the SDGs 5, 14, and 15.

Finally, suggestions are put forward for achieving SUD. China's energy consumption and Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emissions have increased year by year, but the Carbon Peak has not yet been reached. About 85% of CCUS technologies extract CO2 from the air and use it for other emission reduction processes. In addition, the carbon storage time and storage efficiency need to be improved, and the general level can only reach about 60% of the storage efficiency. The secondary use of CO2 by technology is of practical significance to many industries and must be fully implemented from the perspective of the whole life cycle.

Urban ecosystems and trees play a crucial role in improving urban environments, and their management depends on the perceptions and preferences of urban residents. An assessment of the socio-ecological factors determining the perception of the actors allows for the proper design and planning of ecological urban policies and urban adaptation to climate change. The objective of this work was to determine the key determinants (factors) of urban stakeholders’ perceptions of ES in generating socio-ecological information for planning and preservation of ecosystems in Cotonou municipality. In this way, we assessed the perception and discriminating variables of the different stakeholders of urban ES provided in the city of Cotonou. Thus, 381 city dwellers were individually interviewed after statistical sampling. Focus group discussions with the stakeholders also made it possible to highlight the ES provided in the different land use units (LU). The results show that 73.23% of the city dwellers agreed that they were aware of ecosystem services. The hierarchical classification shows two homogeneous groups of perceivers with ethnicity, age, and education as statistically discriminating sociological variables (pv ˂ 0.001). Urban dwellers in the city of Cotonou perceived more SEs in the cultural and regulatory services category significantly (pv < 0.001; v-test > 3).

Numerous researches have been conducted to evaluate performance parameters influencing PV-GR system. Most influencing factor affecting the PV-GR performance is height between PV panel and GR followed by coverage of GR on roof and PV-GR ratio. Optimum height between PV-GR is about 30–70 cm as stated in studies referred, height between PV-GR depends on ET cooling mechanism and air flow between them. Plant species is also an important factor influencing the PV-GR performance but due to large variation between results from different species make this factor hard to evaluate. PV-GR system in monsoon humid sub-tropical climate (Cwa) showed significant result in ambient temperature reduction by 9°C and in enhancement of PV efficiency by 4.25% whereas energy saved of 5% was found significant in cold semi-arid climate (Bsk). Performance parameters affecting PV-GR and its benefits needs to have better understanding and precise value, therefore requires in depth research on this system. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"

As a result, optimum node location estimation and efficient energy usage are two critical IIoT requirements. This work reduces energy consumption by performing node localization and cluster-based routing using an improved evolutionary algorithm called Cat Swarm Optimization (CSO). First, the CSO method is used to optimize the bio-inspired node's location. Second, to conserve SN energy in the IIoT network, a cluster-based routing technique is used. The objective function is defined as minimizing the average distance between the cluster and its SNs while selecting the most energy-efficient Cluster Head (CH). In terms of fitness value, the Improved CSO (ICSO) algorithm outperforms the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. In this paper, real-time test-bed analysis was used to investigate the performance of both node localization and energy-efficient clustering. When it comes to achieving sustainable IIoT and green cities, the findings show that ICSO outperforms in terms of convergence rate and network lifetime. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"

One of the rising concerns in Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 is solid waste management, especially in Makkah. The Solid Waste Collection Problem (SWCP) refers to the route optimisation of waste collection trucks visiting containers across various locations. Manually generated routes might contain some mistakes, and constructing and revising designed solutions can take a long time. Thus, there is a need to find optimal and fast solutions to this problem. Solving this problem demands tackling numerous routing constraints while aiming to minimise the operational cost. Since solid waste has a significant impact on the environment, reducing fuel consumption must be an objective. Methods: Thus, a mixed-integer programming model is proposed in this paper while using the time-oriented nearest neighbour heuristic. The goal is to investigate their performance on nine existing instances of SWCP in the city of Makkah. The proposed model is implemented in the Gurobi solver. The time-oriented nearest neighbour heuristic constructs the initial solution and is then re-optimised using Google OR-tools. Results: Using the greedy method to construct a solution for this problem generated better solutions when compared to the results obtained without the greedy method. Computational times are also improved by 55.7% on the problem instances. Conclusions: The findings confirm the competitive performance of the proposed method in terms of computational times and solution quality. © 2023 by the authors."

Although several countries have released ZEB-enhanced strategies and set national standards and policies to promote ZEBs, construction projects are still limited to demonstration projects. This paper reviews global ZEB activities and state-of-the-art technologies for energy-efficient residential building technologies [based on an evaluation of 40 residential buildings]. Over 40 residential buildings on different continents were reviewed, and their technical details and performance were evaluated. Our results show that 62.5% of the buildings achieved the +ZEB standard, 25% of the buildings were net-zero energy buildings, and only 12.5% of the buildings were near-zero energy buildings. Solar PV is the most widely used renewable energy source in the studied cases, while in warmer climates, advanced cooling technologies and heat pumps are the preferred technologies. A building envelope and thermal ventilation with heat recovery are essential in cold climates. Our systematic analysis reveals that the thermal performance of the building envelope and solar energy are the most effective mechanisms for achieving energy efficiency and shaping sustainable cities. © 2023 by the authors."

These are sometimes contradictory objectives that require fine and deep analysis to create approaches and methods that combine them. The most recent research has presented so-called small urban green spaces (SUGSs) as a viable alternative to achieve this double objective. This was the starting point of this research, which used GIS digital analysis and microscale fieldwork to study the possibilities of greening an excessively dense and low-quality urban space in the city of Pamplona (Spain). The results thereof showed that the urban structure of this neighbourhood contains a large number of small spaces with no specific use or function—residual, surface and vertical spaces—and that are simply undefined remnants between buildings and streets, or party walls that were never built. Only these surface spaces occupy a total area that is twice the size of the existing green spaces. Based on these results, this work explores the possibility of increasing the green areas of the neighbourhood through new SUGSs and the creation of a green corridor that increases environmental and social connectivity and the quality of life in the studied space. © 2023 by the authors."

Whether it is predictable natural disasters, or it is long-term global warming, or any unexpected events, exploring green development that coexists with them, green urban environmental strategies will play an important role in urban development. We analyzed data from 31 sample cities in China, accurately quantified indicators through qualitative and quantitative analysis, and then explored the development status and related indicator systems of green cities in China by “Driving Force–State–Response” model. The results reveal that (1) economic factors are the fundamental and decisive factors for the development of green cities. The higher the level of economic development, the stronger the ability of urban development; we also revealed the indicators that are significantly correlated with the level of green city construction and clarified the important factors of green cities; (2) technological factors are crucial for the construction of green cities. Only with continuous improvement at the technological level do green industries have the driving force for sustainable development, and traditional high-energy consuming and high-pollution industries can be continuously eliminated so as to promote the construction of green cities. (3) Based on the correlation analysis between each indicator and comprehensive scores, this study also pointed out that there is a significant gap in the level of green city construction among different regions in China. © 2023 by the authors."

However, the focus on E-CP infrastructure equity has largely been ignored. For increased uptake of EVs, we argue that future E-CP infrastructure augmentation (EIA) will necessitate the identification of the optimal locations based on a need-focused strategic approach. Our work utilises open datasets and presents a generic multicriteria-based modelling framework for EIA framework. The E-CP Infrastructure Framework a two-stage framework. The first stage assesses the existing infrastructure gap and spatial disparity of E-CP allocation at the city scale. Next, guided by the information from stage one, stage two identifies the optimal E-CP candidate locations for future EIA expansion. The locations are determined using a parametric scoring approach that includes ease of access, available bays for parked vehicles, and potential congestion risk. We take the example of Dresden city to demonstrate the applicability of the EIA framework. Our findings show the wide prevalence of spatial disparities in E-CPs across nine of the ten wards in the city. Our proposed city-scale approach for identifying candidate locations could help policymakers decide on the augmentation strategies of E-CP infrastructure in a spatially equitable and cost-effective manner. © 2023"

Water carrying capacity is a vital part of the carrying capacity of various natural resources in the sustainable development of a region. Appropriately assessing water environment carrying capacity (WECC) is crucial for wise water resources management and economic and social progress advancement. This study developed a WECC evaluation index system for Suzhou, a representative city in southeastern China facing water quality challenges, with the city being an example to study the WECC in the Yangtze River Delta region. By employing principal component analysis (PCA), 20 WECC-related variables were selected from the water and environment, human society, and socio-economic system as the local WECC evaluation indicators. These indicators were weighted by PCA analysis and the entropy method, resulting in overall scores. Evaluating the data from 2001 to 2021, this study showed that the overall WECC score has increased over time. Factors such as rapid urbanization, population growth, economic and social development, and a shortage of water supply have strained the WECC in Suzhou. As an important industrial development zone in the Yangtze River Delta, the city faces significant environmental pollution and water resources problems. The results show that the primary influencing factors are total water resources, surface water resources, water consumption, urbanization rate, water consumption per 10,000 yuan of GDP, industrial value-added water consumption, and chemical oxygen demand (COD) emissions of GDP.

In this study, three typical synoptic circulations types (CTs) that influenced more than 80% of O3 polluted days in Fuzhou during 2014-2019 were identified using a subjective approach. The characteristics of meteorological conditions linked to photochemical formation and transport of O3 under the three CTs were summarized. Comprehensive Air Quality Model with extensions was applied to simulate O3 episodes and to quantify O3 sources from different regions in Fuzhou. When Fuzhou was located to the west of a high-pressure system (classified as “East-ridge”), more warm southwesterly currents flowed to Fuzhou, and the effects of cross-regional transport from Guangdong province and high local production promoted the occurrence of O3 episodes. Under a uniform pressure field with a low-pressure system occurring to the east of Fuzhou (defined as “East-low”), stagnant weather conditions caused the strongest local production of O3 in the atmospheric boundary layer. Controlled by high-pressure systems over the mainland (categorized as “Inland-high”), northerly airflows enhanced the contribution of cross-regional transport to O3 in Fuzhou. The abnormal increases of the “East-ridge” and “Inland-high” were closely related to O3 pollution in Fuzhou in April and May 2018, resulting in the annual maximum number of O3 polluted days during recent years. Furthermore, the rising number of autumn O3 episodes in 2017-2019 was mainly related to the “Inland-high”, indicating the aggravation of cross-regional transport and highlighting the necessity of enhanced regional collaboration and efforts in combating O3 pollution. © 2022"

Fast-growing cities constitute nutrient sinks relying on nutrient-poor hinterlands. We propose a pragmatic waste flow assessment providing authorities with a cross-sectoral view of a city’s nutrient sink status. Following a nested approach, we focus on the origin and fate of a city’s nutrient-containing waste flows, constituting a partial urban metabolism. Application of this method for nitrogen to Maradi, Niger, and Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, shows that the city of Maradi is a nitrogen sink in a still rather sustainable city region food system. Maradi’s Territorial Sustenance index, expressing net N provision from within the territorial system as a share of urban throughput, is around 79%. But Maradi may well be set to evolve towards a situation similar to that of Ouagadougou: a large nitrogen sink with no significant city-hinterland recycling. Ouagadougou exhibits a Territorial Sustenance index of about 5%. Urination constitutes the dominant nitrogen loss pathway and urine-collecting initiatives could provide valuable fertilizer adapted to local agricultural requirements and constraints, increasing the urban system’s sustainability by enhancing regional food provision as well as by reducing sanitation-induced urban water pollution. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

This study discusses this topic with three main objectives; the first is to analyze the project work network of the Sustainable Green City Development Project, the second is to investigate the impact of speeding up the project on network planning, and the third is to determine the cost differences before and after acceleration. The Critical Path Method (CPM) is valuable for managing complex projects if the activity durations are known. However, in reality, the projected durations may vary in the course of a project due to multiple factors, such as equipment breakdowns, human errors, and material shortages. This study used the CPM and crashing methods to determine the optimal project turnaround time using critical path optimization techniques. Analysis using CPM showed that the initial project duration was 1205 weeks but can be reduced to 1197 weeks. However, with acceleration, there is a slight difference, corresponding to a 0.67% decrease in the duration and approximately 8 weeks. The study showed that the total cost of the project work is US $55M at the normal duration and became US $59M after acceleration, which is a slight increase. © 2023, Dr D. Pylarinos.

These urban health issues are escalating, prompting significant attention to the concept of creating “healthy cities”. Meanwhile, the planning and design of urban street space have a far-reaching impact on urban residents’ quality of life and health. Urban planners are facing challenges and need to follow the principle of a green economy while meeting the needs of residents for public activities and adapting to motor vehicle traffic. This study explores the optimization of urban street space to promote the harmonious coexistence between people and cars. This study actively explores the relationship between health, urban environment, and social background, focusing on promoting the harmonious coexistence between people and vehicles, especially the optimization goal of sharing urban streets. The study’s main goal is to design a road that can meet the needs of citizens’ public activities and accommodate motor vehicles, which conforms to the principle of a green economy. To achieve this, geographic information system (GIS) technology and a genetic algorithm (GA) are employed to optimize shared urban street spaces. Among them, GIS tools are used for spatial simulation to evaluate the effect of different shared street space configurations. The urban shared street space is gradually optimized through GA’s selection, crossover, and mutation operations. Simulation experiments are conducted to determine the relationship between street space utilization and the elements of a healthy city, ultimately striving to identify the optimal design parameters for shared street spaces. The research results reveal that the urban street space is optimized from the three aspects of shared allocation of facilities resources, replacement of land use functions, and mixed layout of facilities, and the utilization rate of urban streets is finally ensured to reach 53.43%, fully assuming the essential functions of urban streets. This innovative approach bridges the gap between urban development and public health, offering valuable insights for sustainable urban space planning and enhanced living environments within the framework of the green economy. © 2023 by the authors."

Another objective of this research was to see whether the city for all concept is compatible with the local context. These two research objectives were pursued by using the ‘smart city’ and ‘green city’ perspectives to assess the current development progress. We used qualitative research methods, including fieldwork and in-depth interviews with various actors in both the national and local context, as well as intensive archival research. This study revealed that there is a discrepancy in vision between the government, the city planners, and the locals in East Kalimantan.

Energy harvesting pavements are being widely explored as solar energy is the most abundant source of energy on Earth and 20 to 30% of the urban area is covered by road pavements which are continuously exposed to solar radiation. One of the feasible methods to harvest heat energy from pavements is to collect and transfer heat using a network of fluid pipes embedded in the pavement. It will reduce the pavement temperature during summer and the stored heat energy can be used to melt snow/ice from the pavements during winter. Apart from the conservation of non-renewable energy, these pavements also contribute to urban heat island (UHI) mitigation, extension in pavement life, and provide a smooth riding surface in winter. This paper provides an extensive review of these pipe-pavement energy harvesting systems in terms of the factors affecting their design, impact on thermal performance, construction and economic feasibility of the system. The paper also highlights the scope for further research in this area that will help in improving the efficiency of this system. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"

This requires a scientific approach based on systematic evaluation before recommending them to executive bodies. This study aimed to determine the air pollution tolerance index (APTI), dust retention capacity, and phytoremediation ability of 10 plant species growing in and around a lignite-based coal thermal power station. The results showed that Ficus benghalensis L. had the highest APTI, followed by Mimusops elengi L., Ficus religiosa L., Azadirachta indica A. Juss., and Annona reticulata L. F. benghalensis also showed the highest pH of leaf extract, relative water content, total chlorophyll, and ascorbic acid content, as well as the highest dust capturing capacity. Among the ten plant species, F. benghalensis, M. elengi, F. religiosa, A. indica and F. racemosa were identified as a tolerant group that can be used for particulate matter suppression and heavy metal stabilization in and around thermal power plants. These findings can inform the selection of plants for effective green infrastructure in smart green cities, promoting the health and well-being of urban populations.

"Prizes for fantasy: The role of the urban awards industry in validating greenfield eco-cities","2023","10.1016/j.cities.2023.104418","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85162083512&doi=10.1016%2fj.cities.2023.104418&partnerID=40&md5=87c2c76469476391bd2ea8493e95edf9","A distinct wave of self-proclaimed ‘eco-cities’ has emerged over the past two decades, claiming to pioneer sustainable urban solutions to a range of environmental challenges by building new cities from scratch. Despite little evidence that such projects succeed in achieving their green aims, a burgeoning awards industry is recognizing eco-city developers for their leadership in sustainable urbanism. In this article, we examine Forest City, a new eco-city project in Malaysia, to make three main arguments. First, we introduce the range of awards Forest City has won, showing how the developer uses these awards to generate publicity and push back against criticism. Second, we outline the damage that Forest City has caused to nearby ecosystems and livelihoods to demonstrate the blind spots of awards committees. Third, we argue that awards for projects like Forest City suggest a troubling conflation of sustainable design with spectacular eco-cities, lending credibility to unproven projects that are far from realizing their stated goals. We suggest that the urban awards industry deserves greater critical scholarly attention regarding the ways in which awards-granting agencies and urban prizes contribute to the circulation of normative eco-city ideals, which are often profit-driven and highly damaging to local environments and social sustainability. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"

Design/methodology/approach: Applying the Delphi method, a panel of experts was recruited to conduct three rounds of review to generate dimensions and determine indicators and corresponding weights. This study then verified CAI with statistical data from three sample cities (London, New York and Beijing). Findings: A 12-item three-dimensional index structure (cultural places, cultural activities and cultural atmosphere) was created as CAI. This study also applied the CAI to compare three sample cities. The comparison identified possible aspects to be improved in developing cultural attractiveness, confirming CAI’s usefulness in fostering sustainable development. Originality/value: The new CAI offers an effective tool for ascertaining a sustainable city’s cultural attractiveness while extending the cultural attraction theory and filling the existing gaps in the literature through a benchmark instrument. The CAI also provides an effective tool for destination managers and tourism practitioners for their sustainable initiatives in cities. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"The Effect of Green Intellectual Capital on Green Competitive Advantage in Sustainable City Management","2023","10.32479/ijeep.14434","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85162902756&doi=10.32479%2fijeep.14434&partnerID=40&md5=574a8c54b56d940ebc19ca088e3519b4","Resource-based view (RBV) is a valuable theoretical foundation in analyzing organizational strategic resources to achieve Green Competitive Advantage in green city management. The purpose of this study is to analyze the strategic resources of the Semarang municipal government and this public sector capability in achieving a green competitive advantage in the management of green city. The application of the green city concept aims to create a more sustainable and environmentally friendly environment, by optimizing the use of renewable energy and reducing emissions. The use of this renewable energy can also provide a more stable and secure energy source because it does not depend on the irregular supply of fossil fuels and is vulnerable to price fluctuations. The method used is by quantitative techniques through Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with a number of 116 respondents in Semarang City municipal government was taken as the sample through purposive sampling technique. The findings through quantitative analysis shows that green intellectual capital, eco-innovation and transformational leadership factors have a significant effect on Green Competitive Advantage in the context of green city management. As a suggestion, it is advisable to enhance the capacity for sharing a common vision, facilitating communication among parties involved, implementing sustainable management practices, nurturing human resources, and employing a collaborative governance framework for the purpose of building a green city in Semarang, Indonesia. © 2023, Econjournals.

"Urban constructed wetlands: Assessing ecosystem services and disservices for safe, resilient, and sustainable cities","2023","10.1007/s42524-023-0268-y","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85176785173&doi=10.1007%2fs42524-023-0268-y&partnerID=40&md5=4b7369bdb856073e910a81ae6d0925e1","Climate change and rapid urbanization are pressing environmental and social concerns, with approximately 56% of the global population living in urban areas. This number is expected to rise to 68% by 2050, leading to the expansion of cities and encroachment upon natural areas, including wetlands, causing their degradation and fragmentation. To mitigate these challenges, green and blue infrastructures (GBIs), such as constructed wetlands, have been proposed to emulate and replace the functions of natural wetlands. This study evaluates the potential of eight constructed wetlands near Beijing, China, focusing on their ecosystem services (ESs), cost savings related to human health, growing/maintenance expenses, and disservices using an emergy-based assessment procedure. The results indicate that all constructed wetlands effectively purify wastewater, reducing nutrient concentrations (e.g., total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and total suspended solids). Among the studied wetlands, the integrated vertical subsurface flow constructed wetland (CW-4) demonstrates the highest wastewater purification capability (1.63E+14 sej/m2/yr) compared to other types (6.78E+13 and 2.08E+13 sej/m2/yr). Additionally, constructed wetlands contribute to flood mitigation, groundwater recharge, wildlife habitat protection, and carbon sequestration, resembling the functions of natural wetlands. However, the implementation of constructed wetlands in cities is not without challenges, including greenhouse gas emissions, green waste management, mosquito issues, and disturbances in the surrounding urban areas, negatively impacting residents. The ternary phase diagram reveals that all constructed wetlands provide more benefits than costs and impacts. CW-4 shows the highest benefit-cost ratio, reaching 50%, while free water surface constructed wetland (CW-3) exhibits the lowest benefits (approximately 38%), higher impacts (approximately 25%), and lower costs (approximately 37%) compared to other wetlands. The study advocates the use of an emergy approach as a reliable method to assess the quality of constructed wetlands, providing valuable insights for policymakers in selecting suitable constructed wetlands for effective urban ecological management. © 2023, Higher Education Press."

However, there is a lack of comprehensive studies that assess sustainable cities and human settlements in efforts to attain sustainable development goal 11.5. Here, the present research explains the effect of disaster risk and disaster resilience on human loss due to natural disasters (deaths, injured, and affected) in 90 countries spanning 1995 to 2019. We develop global risk and resilience indices through IMF index-making steps across 24 high, 24 upper-middle, 30 lower-middle, and 12 low-income countries. The negative binomial regression shows an increase in disaster-related loss to human beings (deaths, injured, and affected) due to disaster risk in all panels. The empirical results reveal a favorable impact of disaster resilience––resilience declines disaster-related losses in developed countries. We observe that focusing on basic infrastructure, economic stability, public awareness, hygiene practices, ICT, and effective institutions leads to disaster resilience, mitigation, and speedy post-disaster recovery. Due to the insignificant impact of resilience in developing countries, high-income countries could provide financial resources, modern and DRR technologies, especially to low-income economies. This study encourages countries to follow seven targets and four dimensions of the Sendai Framework to enhance disaster resilience. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."

The use of recyclable express packaging can reduce resource consumption and pollution, but it also leads to additional recycling time and costs. To manage this problem, this paper considers the joint optimization of express parcel delivery and recyclable express packaging recycling. The optimization problem is defined as a simultaneous location and vehicle routing problem with simultaneous pickup and delivery. To exploit better potential to balance vehicle working time and operating costs, a bi-objective mixed integer linear programming model is developed. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method provides a more feasible allocation for facility location and route planning. The cost savings from REP recycling account for 45.36% of the operating costs, which means that the packaging costs are saved and the burden of express packaging waste on the urban environment is correspondingly alleviated. The joint optimization of delivery and recycling is helpful to promote the forward and backward connection of the industrial chain and supply chain, which can provide a reference for recycling network planning in the large-scale application of recyclable express packaging and contribute to sustainable city logistics. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"

"Are we promoting green cities in Latin America and the Caribbean? Exploring the patterns and drivers of change for urban vegetation","2023","10.1016/j.landusepol.2023.106912","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85173877049&doi=10.1016%2fj.landusepol.2023.106912&partnerID=40&md5=731d799be98a90e611ddfefdae2b5188","As cities opt for green policies to address urban socio-ecological challenges it becomes important to evaluate how the urban landscape responds to them, and if these responses are strengthening the benefits of nature for all. The Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) region is one of the most biodiverse and urbanized regions of the world, which makes it imperative to understand how greening policies have impacted the distribution, accessibility, and quantity of vegetated areas in cities through time. Using a landscape ecology approach, we explored the effects of local urban dynamics on the pathways of urban vegetation in ten LAC capital cities in the last 20 years. Our results showed a great fluctuation of vegetation cover change for the region, with Santiago (Chile) losing more than 10% of its urban vegetation to Brasilia gaining 19%, while fragmentation and inequities in the distribution of vegetation increased in all cities. Cities followed four pathways of vegetation change, displaying different patterns of change in fragmentation, size of the vegetated patches and their clustering. This discloses that the greening policies and actions adopted in LAC cities led to increased vegetation cover, or avoided its loss, but did not assure a better distribution of the green and its benefits. Vegetation in LAC cities are still fragmented, where vegetation is not connected and is not equitably distributed, showing that policies in place have not addressed distributional injustice yet. This is corroborated by the assessment of drivers of change where we found social factors were the most important determinants of urban vegetation dynamics. Results from our study provide evidence for developing policies towards urban greening and connectivity, not only to prevent further biodiversity loss but also for creating more resilient communities and cities that address environmental inequities. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"

Design/methodology/approach: The methodological component has been divided into developing a framework for measuring sustainability through economic, social and environmental open data. Moreover, studying the plan's contribution “Benidorm, Destino Turístico Inteligente y Sostenible” to the city's sustainability through a time series analysis. Findings: The main contribution shows that Benidorm's transformation into an STD leads to more sustainable cities. Thus, the conversion of Benidorm into an STD has a sustained effect in the medium and long term, contributing to the sustainability of the city. Research limitations/implications: An open question as a limitation is the subjectivity of the distribution of the relative weight of each indicator. However, statistical analyses are developed to explore the relationship between indicators and global sustainability. Practical implications: The debate to contextualise this paper is bridging the gap between sustainability and tourism intelligence, giving an original framework for measuring destination sustainability that provides a reasonable starting point for comparing tourism sustainability in different destinations. Social implications: Tourists in the 21st century prefer environmentally friendly tourism. Marketing campaigns based on destination sustainability must be based on data rather than mere slogans. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the originality of this paper provides a flexible framework for measuring sustainability from open data sources, being one of the first empirical analyses to study the effects on the sustainability of converting a mature destination into an STD. © 2022, Alexander Aguirre, Antonio Zayas, Diego Gómez-Carmona and José Antonio López Sánchez."

Literature on the interface of inner-city rearing, sustainable cities and urban governance dilemma is limited in African cities. Using the city of Wa in Ghana as a case, this study seeks to understand cattle-rearing practices, driving forces, the public health risk and governance challenges in African cities. The study employed a questionnaire to elicit data from 96 cattle keepers, while interviews were conducted with neighborhood residents and city authorities. Descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression were used to analyze the quantitative data, and thematic analysis employed to analyze the qualitative data. The study found that cattle keepers are spread across the inner-city and keep indigenous, exotic, and crossbreeds. Open grazing and stall feeding were adopted in the wet and dry seasons, respectively. The animals are kept in makeshift structures and open kraals. The holders earn substantial income, making demand for cattle the main determinant of farmers' decision to rear. Although the cattle pose a health risk and cause inconvenience to residents, political interferences and logistical constraints limit local authority's efforts to govern rearing in the inner-city. Based on the challenges and the benefits, city authorities might be faced with trying to strike a balance with sustainable cities' agenda. Therefore, actions towards harmony between livestock rearing, environmental sustainability and human safety are imperative for effective urban governance. © 2023 The Author(s)"

The group concept mapping method allows the collection of the city stakeholder views and translation of these views into a framework through five steps: create statements, sort statements, multidimensional scaling, hierarchical cluster analysis and label clusters. This process generated 80 statements that compose a smart sustainable city, creating a conceptual framework of eight dimensions: green environment, township planning, community-friendly township, utilities management, waste management, smart transportation, digitalisation and technology. A validation stage using a confirmatory composite analysis with a reduced statement list of 40 items and 297 participants was also conducted. These results demonstrated that the stakeholders prioritised non-technical features, such as clean air, clean water and community activities over the need to adopt digital features. New features such as urban agriculture, co-living and others were rated less important, implying that new concepts may require strong community participation and support for implementation from the city authorities. The main contribution of this study is the bottom-up approach using group concept mapping, contrary to the traditional top-down approach, offering a novel method for the conceptualising process. © 2023, The Japan Section of the Regional Science Association International."

While the sustainability development indicators of a city mostly rely on its sustainable development goals (SDGs), no investigations into whether these indicators imply SSCIs have been conducted. SSCIs are critical during the current unprecedented climate crisis and are necessary to facilitate a livable future. This study considers the city of Suwon as a case study. Suwon’s sustainable development policy adopts 10 SDGs among the 17 SDGs from the United Nations, later called Suwon SDGs (SSDGs). By conducting a content analysis, this study found that the indicators adopted from the SDGs require further investigation to evaluate the core SSCIs. Using text analytics, we found that Suwon’s policies focus on indicators in the local environment, such as the employment rates for every age category, even if the SSDG indicators incorporate the SDGs. The purpose of this analysis is to gain more attention from policymakers about the necessity of reconstructing and considering SSCIs as a part of a smart city’s sustainable development.

To limit the amount of waste transported to landfills, it is critical to handle waste properly, notably by segregating recyclables from discarded waste. Waste separation at the source is critical to ensure that generated waste is not completely directed to landfill. The practice of waste separation would initiate the recycling process, which is able to reduce the amount of waste sent to the landfill. Recycling is critical to the achievement of two Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), 11 and 12, for which Malaysian government has set the goal for recycling rates to reach 40% by 2025 in 2022, the rate has reached 33.17%. In Malaysia, recyclables are either collected on-site or sent to a designated facility. The separation at source activity is essential for developing recycling practices. Despite being the largest waste generator, public engagement, particularly at the household level, has remained low, most likely due to recycling facility availability and accessibility issues. Thus, improving public access to the facility would lead to increased recycling rates. In this study, a mixed integer linear programming model is proposed to locate recycling facilities in optimal locations that cover the most amount of waste generated by households. The capacity level is induced to ensure that the dropped-off recyclables are proportionate at the designated facility locations. Several experiments were conducted for validity purposes, and the proposed model was applied in a Malaysian urban area, namely Nilai. As a result, the proposed model was able to locate the optimal locations with the requisite capacity level while ensuring coverage for most Nilai households. © 2023, Magister Program of Material Sciences, Graduate School of Sriwijaya University.

Simultaneously, “tactical urbanism”, embedded within participatory processes, helps to articulate and enrich these policies. In this connection, our study evaluates a number of “what-if scenarios” of “city pruning” by means of realistic, agent-based computer simulations. They regard traffic restrictions for Barcelona with the purpose to identify the impact on travel performance and the environment. Positive counterintuitive effects related to Braess and Daganzo paradoxes are found in new alternatives to the street repurposing plans developed by the City of Barcelona. These result in a reduction of emissions (−8% of main pollutants) and traffic congestion (−14% of travel time) solely by closing some streets to motor vehicles. These findings indicate a formerly unnoticed potential to further improve the quality of urban life. Hence, the use of interactive urban models can be a powerful tool to explore and co-create policies within participatory approaches in spatial planning. Positive counterintuitive effects of street repurposing and network dismantling provide opportunities for participatory and sustainable city-making beyond the ongoing public debate. © 2023 The Author(s)"

This pioneering residential community in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) provides its residents with access to renewable energy storage solutions while adhering to the highest standards of green economy and environmental sustainability. This paper aims to examine the urban planning components of SSC and establish suitable priorities for these elements. To achieve this, we first reviewed and extracted sustainable urban planning elements from existing research. These elements were then organized hierarchically for an expert survey, which was conducted via email. The results were subsequently analyzed using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). Our findings revealed that the transportation system sector was deemed most important, with a score of 0.283, followed by the energy/building sectors at 0.263. Conversely, the park/green area held relatively lower importance, with a score of 0.092. Upon examining the relative importance of 15 specific planning elements (lower criteria), energy-efficient building design emerged as the most critical aspect (0.121). Other highly valued elements included public transportation-oriented development (0.115) and the use of renewable energy (0.102). In contrast, building greening (0.029), establishment of accessible greenway and green matrix in residential areas (0.029), and creation of hydrophilic features for the water circulation system (0.026) were perceived as less significant. This study is expected to serve as foundational data for the future implementation of the SSC master plan in Sharjah. Moreover, it offers valuable insights and a methodology for sustainable urban planning that can be adopted or adapted globally.

To identify the brakes (examples: road safety, urban culture or social norms) on the use of the bicycle and the possibilities of modal shift, a survey was carried out within three main campuses at the University of Liege (ULg) in Belgium. A brief presentation of the main routes and the description of the route most taken (based on cartographic identification, a field visit and interviews) complete the survey results. During this study, 29,000 people (students, doctoral students, and staff members) were contacted to participate in the survey. The results of this work show that despite the topographical conditions of the city studied, a priori unfavourable, and some major obstacles, such as the lack of cycle paths and road insecurity, or the price in the case of the electric bicycle, the potential for a modal shift towards cycling, and particularly towards electric bicycles, is great. 70 % of respondents live less than 12 km from the University, a distance considered the limit for travelling by electric bike. Mitigating these brakes is a priority to stimulate modal shifts. The study of the image of the bicycle and the perception of the brakes shows that better communication could avoid erroneous evaluations as to the possibility of travelling by bicycle. Analysis of the profile of respondents reveals that contrary to the data in the literature, students represent the public least attracted to cycling. Initiating a modal shift to obtain a mass effect is therefore essential. One of the most important factors in pursuing a modal balance is the development of safe cycle paths, where a potential increase in bicycle use is recognized by 62 % of car users, 82 % of bus, 62 % of staff and 74 % of students. Finally, some paths are suggested to improve the downtown-rural cycle route and promote the use of bicycles in the university community. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"

Some scholars argue that Stakeholder Theory could help bridge the environmental ecosystems under a humanist approach. For this reason, this study aims to fill this gap by exploring how Stakeholder Theory and Humanism can be connected to the fostering of sustainable development in cities and society. The main findings highlighted in the urban and societal contexts the role of stakeholder and humanist responsibility, the role of stakeholder consensus about humanist themes and environmental issues, and last but not least important, the need to consider the environment as a non-human stakeholder in social and urban governance. These directions should also be further detailed and explored in the multi/interdisciplinary fields of Sociology, Philosophy, Social Sciences, Humanities, Political Science, and Urban Studies.

Hence, there is a need to reimagine urban infrastructure; it will need to withstand the effects of climate change and the burgeoning inequality in society. Such cultural and economic factors must be addressed through education and policy interventions that align with Mission Lifestyle for Environment (LiFE), which calls for a mass movement towards an environmentally conscious lifestyle. This article shall explore possibilities for India towards creating and transitioning towards resilient cities that complement the goals of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Agenda 2030 through LiFE-oriented behavioural changes, consumption and production patterns. Additionally, India’s G20 presidency has come at a crucial time when the task falls on the most populous state in the world to underline the need to reimagine city planning and urban expansion in the Global South. The G20 can use the platform offered by Urban20, a city diplomacy initiative instituted in 2017 to provide meaningful support to SDG 11 on Sustainable Cities and Communities with the aim of making cities and human settlements more inclusive, resilient, and sustainable. © 2023 National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA)."

This study investigates remote sensing research on SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities) from 2016 to 2023, highlighting the growing interest in the field. By evaluating a large number of selected articles (6820) using a specialized keyword selection strategy and various filters, a significant increase in publication frequency was observed. Remote Sensing and Sustainability were found to be the most relevant journals. A trend towards research addressing urban ecological quality, changes in land use patterns, and the impact of impervious surfaces was found in domain-specific citations. Semi-niche motor themes encompass deep learning, feature extraction, and semantic segmentation. Simultaneously, remote sensing, machine learning, and change detection serve as foundational motor themes, merging elements of both basic and motor themes. The introduction of new analytical methods (e.g., new indices), together with the use of open data and crowdsourcing, has gained great interest. While there has been a strong focus on land cover, urban expansion, and land surface temperature, the main gaps were identified in regional development, disaster, resilience, natural and cultural heritage, housing, and inclusiveness. The findings show the significance of remote sensing research and its practical applications for shaping urban policy, planning strategies, and sustainable urban development. By extracting research patterns using centrality and density analyses and identifying underexplored areas, valuable insights into relationships, significance, and developmental progress within SDG 11-related remote sensing research were gained and may contribute to future planning and informing policymaking decisions. © 2023 by the authors."

Residents’ needs are critical to creating truly pedestrian-friendly streets. The objective of this study was to answer the following questions: What aspects most increase the willingness of citizens to walk? Is the extent to which these aspects are prioritized related to the context in which citizens move on a daily basis? Two linked surveys, conducted through the institutional website of the Department of Civil Engineering and Architectural of the University of Catania, allowed the inclusion of more than 1000 respondents residing in the metropolitan areas of eastern Sicily. The large database was first reduced using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and then statistically processed using Path Analysis. Thus, it was found that in the residential areas of the respondents that were not very “pedestrian friendly”, the macro factors of “safety”, “comfort”, and “quality” of pedestrian infrastructures were equally desirable for citizens to adapt to the existing pedestrian routes and thus promote walking. On the other hand, the “attractiveness” of the urban environment as a whole was a non-statistically significant variable for residents’ decision to walk. These results are not valid for every urban context, but the method used is generalizable and applicable in any urban setting. If the quality, safety, and comfort of pedestrian infrastructure results are important, urban planning should prioritize the provision of safe and accessible sidewalks, crosswalks, and pedestrian streets. Furthermore, if the attractiveness of a neighborhood result is significant, urban design and planning should go beyond functional requirements and also focus on creating a vibrant and livable urban environment. © 2023 by the authors."

In this context, municipalities and logistics service providers aim towards sustainable and profitable city logistics, which are often conflicting goals. Whether to use single-echelon or two-echelon systems with micro-depots and city freighters as well as quantifying the benefits of shipment consolidation between independent providers under different system designs are unanswered questions in academia and practice. We provide a general methodological framework based on continuous approximation theory to study the design of city logistics networks with multiple logistics service providers that choose transportation strategies, each defined by a network structure and specific transportation modes. We provide analytical results on the comparison of different transportation strategies. By providing thresholds on the benefit of consolidated systems, we analytically quantify shipment consolidation effects in city centers. We then embed this continuous approximation into a mixed-integer non-linear program and study parameter sensitivities for a real-world case study. Our results show that higher customer density and longer distances between depots and distribution areas promote 2-tier transportation strategies. Consolidation between logistics service providers allows for emission reductions independent of the transportation strategy and correlate with cost reductions up to 50% on the lower echelon. Outsourcing promotes 2-tier last-mile deliveries with city freighters and in a city with heterogeneous districts, it is beneficial to use a hybrid network that includes both single- and two-echelon strategies using multiple transportation modes for different demand classes. © 2022 Elsevier B.V."

Analysis of urban traffic congestion has revealed that more than 70% of it can be attributed to prolonged searches for parking spaces. Consequently, accurate prediction of parking space availability in advance can play a vital role in assisting drivers to find vacant parking spaces quickly. Such solutions hold the potential to reduce traffic congestion and mitigate its detrimental impacts on the environment, economy, and public health. Machine learning algorithms have emerged as promising approaches for predicting parking space availability. However, comparative studies on those machine learning models to evaluate the best suited for a large-scale prediction and within a given prediction time period are missing. In this study, we compared nine machine learning algorithms to assess their efficiency in predicting long-term, large-scale parking space availability. Our comparison was based on two approaches: using on-street parking data alone and 2) incorporating data from external sources (such as weather data). We used automatic machine learning models to compare the performance of different algorithms according to the prediction efficiency and execution time. Our results indicated that the automated machine learning models implemented were well fitted to our data. Notably, the Extra Tree and Random Forest algorithms demonstrated the highest efficiency among the models tested. Moreover, we observed that the Random Forest algorithm exhibited less computational demand than the Extra Tree algorithm, making it particularly advantageous in terms of execution time. Therefore, this work suggests that the Random Forest algorithm is the most suitable machine learning model in terms of efficiency and execution time for accurately predicting large-scale, long-term parking space availability. © 2023 A.

Therefore, a combination of renewable energy sources integrated with hydrogen production is needed to meet the climate targets. The novel system combinations studied in this paper promote renewable energies, hydrogen production, and electrification to reduce and/or eliminate the dependency on fossil fuels for sustainability. The communities chosen for this study were in Canada [A], South Africa [B], the Netherlands [C] and Denmark [D]. The proposed systems consisted of wind plants (including offshore), solar photovoltaics, and biomass-based integrated systems for power generation, heat recovery, fresh water, bioethanol and hydrogen production. The hydrogen production is considered using a proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer and excess electricity generated from renewables. Sustainable fuel sources for transportation proposed in this system are hydrogen, electrical charging stations and bioethanol. All locations had good potential for renewable power generation and hydrogen production. The maximum capacities for the wind and solar farms in the selected locations are identified as 187.5 MW and 32.7 MW respectively. The actual power generated from the plants varies based on the climate conditions of different locations. At the maximum wind and solar power generated (without accounting for community electrical demand), the maximum annual potential capacities obtained for hydrogen generation are 307 tons for location [A], 232 tons for location [B], 399 tons for location [C] and 487 tons for location [D]. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"

Smart cities have emerged as a response to these challenges, leveraging information and communication technologies (ICTs) to create more efficient and liveable urban environments. However, the concept of smart cities is often defined in vague and ideologically driven terms that lack clear guidelines for promoting sustainability. In this study, we use qualitative methods to examine how the use of ICTs can support the goals of sustainability in smart city development, resulting in what we call a ‘smart sustainable city’. Drawing on a case study involving stakeholder analysis, semi-structured interviews, and document analysis, we investigate the key roles of local government, ICT firms, and citizens in shaping sustainable urban development through smart city initiatives. Our findings shed light on the potential of ICTs to promote sustainability in smart cities and provide insights for policymakers, practitioners, and scholars working towards creating more sustainable urban environments. The findings of this research showed that ICT’s role in supporting sustainability in smart cities relies on understanding the interests and priorities of civic, ICT firms, and citizens, promoting effective collaboration and avoiding self-serving outcomes. © 2023 by the author."

To balance the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainable development, the United Nations adopted several sustainable developmental goals (SDGs), such as SDG 11 for sustainable cities and communities, which aims to improve urban planning and management, including equitable access to urban nature. However, more information is still needed regarding how planners and managers can promote urban nature visitation and equitable access during health and environmental crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this study was to examine trends in urban nature visitation during the pandemic and then to determine if the effect of the pandemic on the frequency of urban nature site visitation varied by distance to home, using an innovative approach of analyzing both publicly available large-scale mobility data and a web-based survey of urban residents of Tel Aviv-Yafo, Israel. The mobility data results showed that there was a negative mean % difference in park visits compared to baseline during the first and third lockdowns, but an increase compared to baseline between lockdowns and even during the second lockdown. This suggests that urban residents had greater need to reconnect with urban nature during and after periods of intense stress. In addition, the survey results showed an increasing negative effect of distance on urban nature site visitation during the pandemic, specifically for urban nature sites located more than 1 km from home. Altogether, the mobility data and survey results suggest that people who lived within 1 km of their preferred urban nature site had disproportionate access to the benefits of urban nature during and after lockdowns than others. To effectively make social and ecological transitions toward urban sustainability, it is vital that cities promote urban nature accessibility during current and future environmental and health crises. Cities should collaborate with diverse stakeholders to create/maintain accessible urban nature sites nearby all sociodemographic groups, provide sustainability education and training to convey the benefits of urban nature, and pursue participatory solutions for understanding urban nature needs and preferences. In this manner, it will be possible to address the growing influence of proximity/travel distance and additional factors that affect urban nature visitation and ultimately, human health and urban sustainability. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited."

Thus, this study represents a comprehensive investigation into food system studies and their impacts on achieving a sustainable community or city. This study is a subset of larger studies that aim to develop an urban food system framework, which utilizes modern approaches in framework development such as sustainability food indicators and a participatory approach. However, to achieve this, trends, gaps, and challenges of the current approach to food system studies need to be reviewed and discussed. A systematic analysis utilizing the protocol of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) approach was conducted, and network analysis of publications was performed via VOS viewer. The results suggest applying circular principles and merging smartness and resilience thinking in developing strategies for food system sustainability. This study finds that key drivers to mitigate food crisis among countries vary. Furthermore, a context-specific framework with a more comprehensive definition of urban food systems covering the institutional processes, and food governance are also needed to achieve urban food system sustainability. © 2023 by the authors."

Following the influx of migrant labourers to work in the region to support the city’s fast-paced development, residential areas have established many migrant labour settlements and have raised scepticism among the local communities. This has led to a debate among the authorities about whether to remove migrant labour settlements in residential areas. However, the determinants that shape local community perception to reject migrant settlement remained unclear. This study conducted a survey among residents in the Iskandar Development Region to understand the determinants that influence their acceptance towards migrant settlements and analysed the data using partial least square–structural equation model (PLS–SEM) analysis. The findings imply that to improve acceptance of migrant settlement among the city’s community, we should give priority to resolving the local community’s concerns, consisting of four main issues (in descending order): crime and safety, declines in property value, hygiene issues, and a poor physical appearance of the settlement. To this end, this paper provides policy recommendations for both the government and the community about coping with migrant settlements in a fast-paced developing city. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."

The spread of the coronavirus occurs a lot in the workplace. Indoor health and comfort play an important role in providing a healthy and comfortable workplace. Work patterns during the Covid-19 pandemic have changed with the work from home and physical distancing policies. The arrangement of the workplace interior accompanied by indoor health comfort can affect the work experience of occupant. This study aims to produce an adaptive workplace layout design with an indoor health and comfort approach based on occupant perception toward sustainable city. This study uses mix methods with observation and questionnaire survey techniques. The object of research is ten offices in the Medan city, Indonesia. Observations were made to analyze the layout of the workplace, then questionnaires were distributed to employees to analyze their perceptions of comfort and the application of health protection in the workplace. The variables are lighting, ventilation, temperature and humidity, distance of workbench, and health protection. The results showed that the workplace must provide good air quality with the exchange of air through ventilation. Workbench spacing and the use of barriers are most recommended. A workplace with cubical layouts can be arranged parallel to the desk divider as a screen between desks. Whereas in a workplace with non-cubical layouts, work desks can use zig-zag or non-parallel seating arrangements and dividers between tables. Office buildings should prepare a workplace that concerned with space efficiency and comfortable indoor space. © 2023, Kauno Technologijos Universitetas. All rights reserved."

The key types of blue-green infrastructures (BGIs) are constructed wetlands, water retention basins, green roofs, and permeable pavements. Bioretention systems are made of plants and a layer of mulch, and soil where both plants and soil medium reduce the runoff volume and contaminant concentration in the stormwater. Recently, biochar has been applied to bioretention systems due to its porous structure, which facilitates the adsorption of inorganic and organic pollutants. However, most of these were laboratory studies with synthetic or semi-synthetic stormwater and thus had little ecological parallel and resemblance with real-life (field) situations. Therefore, we critically discuss the use of biochar and modified biochar-incorporated bioretention systems constructed in both laboratories and pilot scales in metropolitan areas and the efficiency improvement of the BGIs. Most reviews in the existing literature mainly focused on the BGI types, major components in bioretention systems, and their functionality in stormwater management. However, a systematic analysis of biochar and modified biochar incorporated bioretention systems in both laboratories and pilot scales is scarce. Biochar-incorporated bioretention systems significantly reduced the effluent volume and contaminant concentration in stormwater. Additionally, biochar supports the growth of plants in the bioretention system and adds aesthetic value to the surrounding area. However, the efficiency of the bioretention system varies with several factors, such as the composition of the filter medium, properties of stormwater, plant types, and different environmental aspects. Hence, additional field-based research is required to estimate the benefits of biochar in the bioretention systems' efficiency. © 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry."

However, there is a gap between knowledge and policy objectives, and their translation into effective interventions to unleash the benefits of green spaces. Examining such ‘implementation gap’ in Zurich is relevant due to the integration of the ‘green urban agenda’ in various Swiss policies. The research narrows its focus to district 9, including the Altstetten and Albisrieden neighborhoods, which contain diverse green spaces despite ongoing densification. The study further explores four green space clusters and their 400-m catchment areas within the district. The research applies a mixed-method approach at three analytical levels: (1) identification of the critical tenets associated with the ‘green urban agenda’ through a review of multi-scale national policies, (2) assessment of green spaces’ provision, types, size, and mutual connectivity in Zurich’s district 9 based on online available quantitative data and on-site observation, and (3) identification of the dominant activities in four green space clusters through on-site observation. Through critical mutual examination of the identified ‘green urban agenda’ principles in the national policies and green space attributes, the findings reveal the extent of the convergence or divergence between policy trends and their implementation in practice. © 2023 by the authors."

However, with the recent surge in the availability of crowdsourced data, a dynamic view of urban systems has emerged. Recognizing the value of these data, this study illustrates how these data can bridge gaps in understanding urban interactions. Furthermore, the role of urban planners is crucial in harnessing these data effectively, ensuring that derived insights align with the practical needs of urban development. Employing the Design Science Methodology, the research study presents an assessment model grounded in the principles of the city ecosystem, drawing from the General System Theory for Smart Cities. The model is structured across three dimensions and incorporates twelve indicators. By leveraging crowdsourced data, the study offers invaluable insights for urban planners, researchers, and other professionals. This comprehensive approach holds the potential to revolutionize city sustainability assessments, deepening the grasp of intricate urban ecosystems and paving the way for more resilient future cities. © 2023 by the authors."

In this regard, the related concept of “sustainability” has been gaining traction, with use of the word rising considerably since the 1990s. The term itself has been defined in many different ways, however, the core components are becoming common knowledge: economic, environmental, and social—informally referred to as profits, planet, and people. As Borden has aptly noted: “Sustainability ideas are growing and maturing at many levels worldwide”. One way that people come to know about sustainable development and its importance is through media coverage of the movement via various projects and initiatives that have been proposed on a theoretical or conceptual basis, as well as those models which have already been concretely realized. One such project established in 2015 is Dubai’s “Sustainable City’, the emirate’s first net-zero energy working model, which received attention in the world press. This paper investigates and compares the coverage that the Sustainable City has received in the global and local media by utilizing a content analysis methodology guided by framing theory. The research joins the discussion on issues regarding how the media discuss aspects of “sustainability” and how it takes hold within a society, whether it be by grassroots or government policy. © The Author(s) 2023."

The ensuing debates among the L'viv city government, the national government, and local stakeholders show how waste management becomes a mechanism through which to interrogate questions of state-citizen relations and what it means to be part of Europe. This article argues that processes of Europeanization rely on the arbitrary application of standards and result in a hierarchy in which countries such as Ukraine are considered not-yet-fully European. However, this does not prevent pro-European Ukrainians, who ground their vision of Ukraine's European future in the 2013–2014 Euromaidan protests, from advocating for Ukraine to adopt European standards. This article homes in on the shifting relationship between citizens and state representatives and the development of ecological consciousness as key points by which interlocutors measured Ukraine's path toward Europe, showing how the crisis around waste management in L'viv allows for the contestation of Europeanness itself. While not all Ukrainians have adopted these ideas about European Ukraine, in the context of Russia's devastating invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Ukrainians have become increasingly united around the idea of a European future. ©2023 by the American Anthropological Association."

To fulfil these requirements, we propose a general construction of ideal threshold changeable multi-secret sharing scheme (TCMSS) with information-theoretic security, in which polynomials are employed to achieve dealer-free and non-interactive in the secret reconstruction phase. The TCMSS scheme can be built on any existing linear secret sharing scheme, and it is simpler and more efficient than the existing TCSS schemes in the literature. The main difference between TCMSS and Shamir's SS is that univariate polynomial is used in Shamir's SS to generate the shares for all shareholders; while in TCMSS, each shareholder can recover her own univariate polynomial using her share. This article demonstrates that with this novel modification, the classic polynomial-based SS can be transformed into an ideal TCMSS. Moreover, the TCMSS scheme is lightweight and it can resist both internal and external attacks. It does not require pairwise key distribution and its secret reconstruction phase is improved with enhanced properties. Therefore, the designed proposal is fairly suitable and attractive to be deployed in sustainable cities. © 2023"

It explores the relationship between policy transfers and paradigm shifts and discussing the thesis of a “Chinese art” of policy transfers, according to which Chinese policymakers operate a form of cherry-picking that prefers technical recommendations over policy or procedural recommendations and is dictated by “national self-interest.” Based on a longitudinal study of the transfer of a renewal paradigm to a Chinese city, Yangzhou, the study shows that the transfer resulted in significant policy change, going beyond technical aspects. Therefore, the thesis of “Chinese art” is not confirmed. However, a full-fledged paradigm shift was not observable as elements of the old paradigm are still present. Policy transfers can thus result in paradigm shifts, but their institutionalization is likely to be slow and gradual. © 2023 The Authors.

The integration of IoT in smart cities has altered the manner of working and living of society. IoT technologies do, however, come with a number of drawbacks, including vulnerability of highly secure devices, energy consumption, governance, etc. in smart cities. Governance in smart city is more citizen-center and the decisions of government are focused on citizens’ demands. Government can identify influential spreaders from this huge voluminous population and take requisite preventive steps such as delaying the spread of rumor, identifying the information source, or blocking the source node. Hence, security of highly vulnerable IoT device and governance are the two main issues of the IoT environment of smart green city. This paper proposes a framework for identifying influential spreaders who play a key role in the governance of smart city as well as determining vulnerable IoT devices that needs to be protected from malware attacks. A framework named as Modified Dynamic Weighted Sum Method, is proposed for determining influential devices and spreaders in smart green cities. The connectivity between devices is considered as a network, then, distinct centrality measures are considered as the multi-attribute of the network, so as to take advantage of each centrality measure. Experiments are conducted on Santender testbed and it was found that static devices play an important role in IoT environment. Hence, they need to be protected from malware attacks.

However, multi-city empirical research on green city assessment in China has so far been limited, leaving plenty of room for improvement in the understanding of the issues regarding (1) characterization of disparities in the green development status among cities; (2) identification of key factors leading to the disparities; and (3) exploration of potential approaches to promoting green city development. This study integrates comprehensive index analysis, coordination analysis, difference analysis, and correlation analysis into an analytical toolbox, and investigates the green development of 36 major cities in China in 2015. The overall performance of these cities was not high, and showed clear regional imbalance. Relatively small cities, and the green transformation of consumption, deserve more concern in the near future. Other than a conventional comprehensive index, coordination degree brings a novel perspective to understand the green development status of cities. The key indicators contributing to the performance difference among the cities were generally related to sustainable lifestyles and decoupling consumption from resources and environmental pressures. In the end, increase of economic development quality, stimulation of social innovation, improvement of urban infrastructure, and appropriate urban density are proposed as policy suggestions to facilitate cities' green transition. © 2023"

In order to address such issues, assessing the current situation of European metropolises is crucial to understanding new urban development models. In light of these dynamics, our study focused on urban expansion in Pafos, Cyprus, between 1993 and 2021. Such dynamics were examined through photointerpretation (using kernel density estimation) via the ArcGISPro spatial analyst tool. The empirical results of this analysis are considered particularly insightful, especially those regarding urban sprawl and its implications for future land management for the study area, and could help toward shaping specific policies to guide cities towards sustainable and environmentally friendly development. The analysis reveals a gradual increase in settlements over time (55%), although the rate of growth has decreased in recent years, as a consequence of the economic crisis. Density maps revealed varying levels of urban concentration density, highlighting the presence of high-density settlement cores downtown and low-density, dispersed settlements in the surrounding districts. According to the empirical findings of this study, urban growth in Pafos features fragmented development patterns with scattered building landscapes and large empty spaces. To address the challenges of urban sprawl in the study area, specific actions are proposed to promote sustainable urban development and mitigate its negative impacts. By examining Pafos building/settlement development and urban planning, stakeholders can gain valuable insights and implement viable solutions for the future. This study contributes to the evolving discourse on urbanization, its characteristics, causes, and consequences, and highlights the importance of the “compact city” model as a counterforce to urban sprawl and a pathway to sustainability. © 2023 by the authors."

However, smart public spaces are required to save time and costs, and to provide comfort to the public, ultimately enhancing livability. There are various user requirements and demands to respond to. This research aims to adopt intelligent technologies applied in public spaces to facilitate livability through urban facility management (UFM) involvement in improving livability. The establishment of intelligent systems in the architecture industry goes hand in hand with the growing advancement of science and technology in several aspects of human life. A fundamental key to the success of smart cities is the high quality of livability offered to their residents and visitors. The UFM can enable livability by providing data centers, access controls, integrated security systems, monitoring, smart waste, energy and water management in public spaces. This study focused on five elements of livability, including accessibility, functional infrastructure, interaction and social cohesion, amenity and participation, quality of life through safety and security and privacy. The research methodology adopts the activity theory (AT) as its underpinning theory for the qualitative data collection process (interviews and a workshop) from industry experts in two prominent smart cities in Qatar, Lusail and Msheireb, along with a literature review. This study’s results provide information on existing smart city and public space features, infrastructures and their impact on livability. The findings of this study support the development of the smart livable public spaces (SLiPS) framework. The framework is a baseline for improving livability in smart cities, which allows future updates based on existing ICT infrastructure, enabling new functions and the availability of novel technology applied by UFM. The outcome of livability leads to the achievement of smart city goals. © 2023 by the authors."

It is of great significance to recover P and K from wastewater, which can reduce phosphate and potash ore mining and ensure secure fertilizer supply for the sustainable development of cities. The potassium magnesium phosphate (MgKPO4·6H2O; MPP) is recovered from wastewater. The current work systematically assessed the fertilizer efficiency of MPP by investigating its effect on seed germination, root development and growth of ryegrass. The experimental results showed that MPP promoted the growth of ryegrass at a relatively lower dosage (0.3 g MPP/pot). Compared with the commercial fertilizer of KH2PO4 (MKP), MPP shortened the germination time of ryegrass and increased the content of chlorophyll because it also contained magnesium. The loss rate of P in MPP was 12.66% lower than that in the MKP. When MPP was used, the soil's acidity was improved with the pH value of 6.75. Indeed, MPP was an effective fertilizer that could promote the growth of ryegrass, reduce the loss of nutrients and slightly improve the soil acidity. Therefore, it is of great significance to develop the crystallization of MPP for recycling P and K from wastewater, which favors the sustainable development of cities. © 2023"

Urban farming can help produce fresh food locally and help urban residents become self-reliant by engaging in healthy eating habits and practicing sustainable agricultural techniques in food-desert areas, while creating a positive impact on the environment through regenerative agricultural methods. In doing so, urban farms can help the growers save on food expenditures and even earn some additional income, while also improving air quality and minimizing the effects of urban heat islands. This practice also helps reduce greenhouse gases through plant carbon use efficiency (CUE), as vegetation carbon dynamics (VCD) can be adjusted while supporting the circular economy. As urban lands command higher prices than agricultural land, urban farming usually happens on residential yards, roofs, balconies, community gardens, and dedicated areas in public parks. Rainwater harvesting and redirecting can help irrigate urban farms, which can be part of rain gardens. The national census of 2021 identified that 66% of Nepal’s population lives in urban areas. However, the World Bank (2018) showed that only 21 of Nepal’s population was projected to live in urban areas in 2021. It is not debatable that the urbanization process in Nepal is on the rise. Thus, urban agriculture can play an important role in supplementing residents’ food needs. Many cities in Nepal have already successfully adapted to urban farming wherein residents grow food on their building sites, balconies, and rooftop, often growing plants in pots, vases, and other types of containers. The UN-Habitat, with the support of the European Union and local agencies, published a rooftop farming training manual (2014), showing the feasibility of urban farming in Nepal. This paper discusses how public-private partnership (PPP) can promote urban agriculture and make the process more effective and attractive to urban-farming households. It also analyzes how a PPP approach also facilitates the use of better technology, advisory support, and use of research extension activities. This paper draws on a literature review, uses remote-sensing imagery data and data from National Census Nepal 2021, and the authors’ professional experiences related to best practices in the areas to analyze the benefits and challenges related to urban farming both in Nepal and Arizona, USA. The paper provides recommendations for Nepali cities to maximize the benefit provided by urban farming. It is expected to be useful to Nepali policymakers, government agencies, and nonprofit organizations which promote sustainability, and organic farming with a sustainable supply chain. © 2023 by the authors."

The present study addresses the problem of the lack of guidelines that help in linking different principles of urban design and indicators of smart and ecological interventions in both the early planning and upgrading stage to support cities’ sustainable future. Therefore, the research aims to identify smart-eco cities dimensions and indicators to use in developing a conceptual framework for developing smart-eco cities strategies, to be applied in cities nowadays. The study merges between smart and ecological urban dimensions as novel urban approaches in addition to focusing on the characteristics, guidelines, and indicators for smart and eco-cities to attain UN 2030 sustainable development goals. The present work follows a methodology that encompasses four parts. The First part is an integrative literature review for the main concepts, definitions, and dimensions for both smart cities and eco-cities in addition to SDGs. Moreover, it reviews and analyses different initiatives for cities that followed smart and ecological approaches. The Second part is an analytical approach proposing a matrix that combines both smart and eco-cities dimensions and indicators to achieve a healthier and sustainable urban future by mapping it to UN-SDGs. Moreover, a survey was administered to highlight the most effective indicators in developing smart eco-cities strategies. The Third part proposes a conceptual framework to be used for planning smart-eco cities for better urban futures. Finally, the study applies the proposed framework on a new Egyptian city as a case study to identify the potential of applying smart-eco cities concept in developing countries and limited resources settings.

Both floating-type and bifacial-type photovoltaic arrays are integrated with a high-temperature gas-cooled small modular reactor. In the integrated system, a Rankine cycle subsystem for power generation, a solid oxide electrolyzer for hydrogen production, a pressure swing adsorption unit with ammonia reactor for nitrogen and then ammonia production, a multi-effect desalination unit for freshwater generation, and heat recovery units in order to provide heating to residential area, food drying facility, greenhouse, and fish farm facilities. For both floating and bifacial PV options, the 120 MWp PV modules are considered and integrated with two small modular reactor units at 250 MWth capacities each, 500 MWth in total. A thermodynamic analysis, which is based on energy and exergy approaches, is carried out. The time-dependent analyses are carried out for floating-type PV and bifacial-type PV options for the cities of Istanbul in Turkey; Barcelona in Spain; Los Angeles (LA) in the United States; Tokyo in Japan; and Toronto in Canada by using their hourly meteorological data, source and load capacities in a typical meteorological year. Among ten cases, between 112835 and 146180 tonnes of ammonia are generated in a typical year while meeting the heating and power requirements of sustainable communities in metropolitan areas. Among ten cases, the average overall energy and exergy efficiencies are found as 41.04% and 46.88%, respectively. The hybridization of such nuclear and solar systems achieves unique advantages by preventing intermittencies compared to the renewable-alone systems, reducing carbon emissions compared to fossil-based systems, and lowering the levelized costs of energy compared to the nuclear energy-alone systems. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"

Conventional load frequency control has difficulty overcoming the above problems due to its lack of adaptive control ability and robustness. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes a sea computing-based grid-area coordinated load frequency control (SCGAC-LFC) method, which equates each grid unit and area unit in each area as independent agents. Instead of different units relying on different strategies, all units collectively obtain the LFC policy that suits the market requirements. In its online application, no communication is needed since each unit can arrive at its own decision. In addition, this paper proposes a curriculum multiagent deep meta-actor-critic (CMA-DMAC) algorithm, which introduces meta-reinforcement learning and curriculum learning to guide the agent training to improve the robustness and quality of the obtained SCGAC-LFC strategies. Using a simulation of the four-area LFC model for the China Southern Grid (CSG), our proposed method carries significantly lower frequency error and regulation mileage payment. © 2023"

These statistical analyses allow the assessment of the impact of various independent variables on the promotion of healthy mobility behavior within urban settings. The multiple regression shows that the satisfaction with the accessibility of public transport and the sense of safety as a cyclist contribute to explaining the variation of healthy mobility. Furthermore, the satisfaction with walking in the neighborhood and the inhalation of exhaust fumes while walking also seem to have an impact. The results show the link between the Triad and make it clear that mobility planning and urban planning must take a more integrated approach to promote health and simultaneously protect the climate. © 2023 by the authors."

The incorporation of electric vehicles (EVs) is a key component in creating sustainable cities. However, the development of smart cities for EVs entails more than just the installation of charging stations. Software engineering plays a crucial role in realizing smart cities for electric vehicles. This paper examines the role of software engineering in the creation of smart cities for electric vehicles, the techniques utilized in electric vehicle charging infrastructure, the obstacles faced by software engineers, and the future of software engineering in sustainable cities. Specifically, the paper explores the significance of software engineering in integrating EVs into the transportation system, including the design of smart charging and energy management systems, and the establishment of intelligent transportation systems. Additionally, the paper offers case studies to demonstrate successful software engineering implementations for smart cities. Finally, the paper concludes with a discussion of the challenges that software engineers encounter in implementing intelligent transportation systems for EVs and provides future directions for software engineering in sustainable cities. © 2023 by the authors."
"Predicting solar radiation in the urban area: A data-driven analysis for sustainable city planning using artificial neural networking","2024","10.1016/j.scs.2023.105042","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85177241415&doi=10.1016%2fj.scs.2023.105042&partnerID=40&md5=7b6e1b3db31eb697d3addcb5400bfea2","Predicting solar radiation in cities using the Artificial Neural Network model (ANN) is a pioneering step in transforming future-oriented city planning using solar energy. This research harnesses vast datasets to forecast the average annual solar radiation, considering minimal urban information across various urban attributes, including coordinates (X, Y, Z), average height, inhabited and non-occupied areas, and the Azimuth angle. Our method employed parametric design and remote sensing to generate this dataset and then used the ANN model to make predictions and simulations. Urban attributes of 20 cities were examined, including Casablanca, Abu Dhabi, Cape Town, Dublin, Havana, Melbourne, Rome, Singapore, Nairobi, Mumbai, New York, Nagoya, Sao Paulo, Tehran, Madrid, Toronto, Antananarivo, Beijing, Lisbon, and Paris. This data-driven approach trains our ANN model to discern complex and nonlinear relationships between independent and dependent variables and thus enables our model to predict solar radiation in urban cities. Our data training results indicate that the output (the minimum solar radiation each year of the cities) can be predicted using the study input variables with a loss of 0.01, a mean squared error of 0.01, and an R2-squared value of 85%. Such predictions can refine urban designs of buildings, public spaces, and various urban infrastructures to optimize solar energy use, reducing environmental impacts and fossil fuel reliance, thus aiding climate change mitigation and sustainability. Our findings underscore the integral association between solar radiation and sustainable urban evolution, giving urban planners and researchers sustainable strategies for advancing energy efficiency and ecological equilibrium. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"
"Sustainable Cities, Smart Investments: A Characterization of “A Thousand Days-San Miguel”, a Program for Vulnerable Early Childhood in Argentina","2023","10.3390/su151612205","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85169088955&doi=10.3390%2fsu151612205&partnerID=40&md5=2cf50ffb224bc375d851e90ba34cb2a2","In this paper, we provide a thorough description of the “Programa de Acompañamiento Familiar Mil Días” (A Thousand Days, Mil Días), introduced in 2015 in the Municipality of San Miguel, Buenos Aires, Argentina. The program is targeted at pregnant women and mothers with children of up to two years of age who are in a situation of extreme social and health vulnerability. While the target relevant period is the first thousand days of life, from gestation to two years of age, the intended duration is about a year, or until entrance criteria are overcome. We combine statistical analysis of the program’s primary data with qualitative analysis from two in-depth interviews. Our evidence confirms that Mil Días-SM effectively reaches a highly vulnerable population that exhibits interlocking material and educational deprivations, frequently combined with conflict-home environments, and children experiencing health neglect. The one-on-one mentoring provided through the program, along with a battery of other interventions, brings knowledge and support to these families. Children start receiving appropriate stimuli, mothers become aware of the importance of health care for them and their children, and they start feeling more empowered to take command of their lives and families. While the program exhibits remarkable attributes, we identify three aspects in which it could be improved: extending the intended duration time, reducing its dropout rate devising tools to retain the most vulnerable cases, and scaling up its coverage. Current evidence suggests programs like Mil Días are smart investments that can simultaneously contribute to achieving several Sustainable Development Goals. © 2023 by the authors."

It is vital to thoroughly summarize this research and investigate its development trends for sustainable cities. The advent of bibliometrics has given rise to a new method of conducting systematic reviews. We wish to illustrate the evolution of the TOD field by applying scientometrics, with the aim of revealing trends in this field and establishing a scientific classification system. We employ visualization software such as VOSviewer and CiteSpace to conduct bibliometric analyses on TOD-related publications from the WOS database from 1994 to 2021. Potential TOD-related research hotspots and cutting-edge research trends are thoroughly examined. The results indicate that TOD research topics are diverse, with hot topics related to land use, built environment, travel behavior, etc. The regions studied in TOD research are mostly metropolitan areas. Based on a modest number of starting keywords, this strategy can be used to build a more relevant and deeper research network. Through expanding the research content and improving research methods, this paper can provide insights into identifying the evolution of TOD research in different locations of the world, as well as provide a reference for the application and implementation of TOD strategies. © 2023 by the authors."
"Community Approach for Public Flower Garden Renovation in Hanoi Center: Perspective for Building a Green City","2023","10.3390/w15152712","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85167684282&doi=10.3390%2fw15152712&partnerID=40&md5=e111bf16a202e2e5e20bf5e79181c81b","Public gardens in urban areas play an important role in the development of physical and mental health of the people. These spaces are also social spaces, where people meet to interact, exchange, and organize collective activities. They create a unique identity for each residential area in the city, which is a premise for green urban development. In Hanoi, public flower gardens (PFGs) were formed and developed from the French colonial period, mainly those in the historic city centre. Facing the forceful urbanization process and the changing of urban structure, in order to evaluate the role of all public flower gardens in the historic city centre area, we carried out a systematic survey from 2019 to 2022. We surveyed all 30 PFGs in five central districts of Hanoi, and interviewed 229 users at these gardens. We also conducted research on relevant documents regarding the management and planning of green space and water infrastructure in the city. Moreover, we implemented an experimental workshop, combining an urban living lab (ULL) approach and an in situ landscape approach, to develop urban landscape design ideas with community participation. Based on the data from this research, this paper analyzes the potential for the establishment of urban blue-green infrastructure (BGI) from these PFGs and aims to evaluate the role of community participation in landscape design for the city. Data from multiple collection methods provide a multi-faceted understanding of the original characteristics of the PFGs in Hanoi and their importance in urban life. The project results supply experimental lessons from urban landscape design activities through community participation, which opens up the potential for developing sustainable urban spaces based on existing natural structures in the city. The main result proves that active community participation until the end of the research project raises public awareness and ensures the social acceptance of the final design. These lessons allow the improvement of urban landscape design practices and the establishment of BGIs from PFGs in an efficient and sustainable manner for green cities in the future. © 2023 by the authors."

The analysis consists of an analytical framework founded on the literature regarding the UN Sustainable Development Goal “Sustainable Cities and Communities” (SDG 11, United Nations). The study applies the analytical framework to the city builder, observing that many aspects of sustainable city development can be employed when building a city in “Cities: Skylines”. While the analysis suggests that the in-game feedback is very neutral vis-à-vis sustainability, the game offers a vast digital space where players and pupils learning geography can practically experience and experiment with the complexity of urban geography. Thus, “Cities: Skylines” could offer the opportunity to familiarize learners with “Sustainable Cities and Communities”. The analysis helps to assess the extent to which the game can be of educational benefit for geography education despite its commercial character. The paper concludes with educational implications and emphasizes the opportunity to experience sustainable city development in the digital simulation game “Cities: Skylines”. © 2023 by the authors."

Production of renewable energy is the eighth sustainable development, based on the data from the 30 Chinese provinces (2000–2017). This study presents an analysis of the effects of green digital finance on green innovation on protection of environment using influence mechanism analysis. Digital finance, which has become a major driver of green innovations in China, may first increase the number and quality of green technical innovation. The results show that the promotion effect of digital finance on the efficiency of renewable energy markets is greater than the inhibitory effect, making the total effect less obviously favorable. In other results, the elasticity of lnGFDI is significant at the 5% level and is 0.1545% and 0.1880% in the present and 1-year delayed periods, respectively. Further, the average total effect of FDI on the effectiveness of green innovation is 0.008, with an average encouraging effect of 0.0051 and an average inhibiting effect of 0.0039. We conclude that diverse behavior for that policy support increases the impact of green digital finance, promote green innovation, and generate emission free environment for sustainable energy markets. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."
"Efficient Energy Management for the Smart Sustainable City Multifloor Manufacturing Clusters: A Formalization of the Water Supply System Operation Conditions Based on Monitoring Water Consumption Profiles","2023","10.3390/en16114519","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85161667033&doi=10.3390%2fen16114519&partnerID=40&md5=b88c7eb965d3609e5d4ba3a259e0ff10","This study is devoted to improving the energy efficiency of urban infrastructure systems (UISs), in particular, the centralized water supply of a city multifloor manufacturing cluster (CMFMC), by developing the principles of effective energy consumption management. The CMFMCs are located in the residential area of a megapolis and include manufacturing and service enterprises, residential and non-residential buildings, and a city logistics node. Demand monitoring and identification of the influence of seasonal and social environmental factors on its fluctuations is considered as a tool for identifying changes in the operating conditions of the water supply system (WSS) for the CMFMC facilities. To identify the typical operating conditions of water supply facilities, an approach is proposed that involves the analysis of daily water consumption profiles (WCPs). The formation of a database, the formation of groups of the same type of daily WCPs, and the construction of typical daily WCPs for typical groups and their description are the main stages of the proposed approach. The database contains a set of classification characteristics that describe the daily water consumption and its unevenness, as well as the shape of the daily WCP. The principal component analysis was applied to determine the dominant components of daily water consumption. A set of morphometric parameters was used to describe the shape of the daily WCPs. The methods of cluster and discriminant analysis were used to identify the influence of seasonality and social factors on water consumption and to form groups of the same type of daily WCPs. The analysis of sets of similar type of daily WCPs for typical days of typical seasons was carried out for a formalized description of the typical operating conditions of water supply facilities. The results of the analysis are the clarification of the equations of the dominant components of daily water consumption, the determination of the average values of the characteristics of daily water consumption, and the construction and description of typical daily WCPs for typical operating conditions of water supply facilities. The research results were obtained on the basis of the data of the monitoring systems for water supply enterprises in Ukraine and Poland in 2021–2022. The obtained results are the basis for planning the water supply process and adjusting the operation modes of WSS pumping stations for the CMFMC, as well as planning power consumption for typical operating conditions, which will contribute to increasing the efficiency of water and electricity use. © 2023 by the authors."

The assessment is based on climate change, ozone depletion, terrestrial acidification, freshwater eutrophication, human toxicity, photochemical oxidant formation, ecotoxicity, water depletion, and fossil fuel depletion impacts. The LCA findings reveal that membrane-based systems (HMBAC and DEVap) are highly environmentally-friendly in comparison to the regular VAC systems (household split coolers), showing the capability of membranes in developing efficient air conditioning systems. In addition, solar-assisted systems reduce seven out of eleven environmental impacts, while they cause severe eutrophication, marine and freshwater ecotoxicity, and human toxicity consequences. Furthermore, it is unveiled that the inverter can reduce up to 38% of the environmental impacts of VAC systems which are the most common air conditioning system in buildings. Therefore, the manipulation of the inverter system in VACs can be considered as one of the short-term solutions in reducing the environmental footprints of air conditioning. Finally, the sensitivity analysis is applied to show the reliability of the outcomes. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"

To achieve the above goals for the sustainable growth of societies, it is crucial to study gender-based violence (GBV) in a smart city context, which is a common component of violence across socio-economic groups globally. This paper analyzes the nature of news articles reported in English newspapers of Pakistan, India, and the UK—accumulating 12,693 gender-based violence-related news articles. For the qualitative textual analysis, we employ Latent Dirichlet allocation for topic modeling and propose a Doc2Vec based word-embeddings model to classify gender-based violence-related content, called GBV2Vec. Further, by leveraging GBV2Vec, we also build an online tool that analyzes the sensitivity of Gender-based violence-related content from the textual data. We run a case study on GBV concerning COVID-19 by feeding the data collected through Google News API. Finally, we show different news reporting trends and the nature of the gender-based violence committed during the testing times of COVID-19. The approach and the toolkit that this paper proposes will be of great value to decision-makers and human rights activists, given the prompt and coordinated performance against gender-based violence in smart city context—and can contribute to the achievement of SDGs for sustainable growth of human societies. © 2022, Crown."

Thus, the strain from urbanisation generates issues like water pollution and land degradation leading to further social and environmental problems. Smart sustainable cities have been proposed as a possible solution but are a relatively new concept and are theoretically underdeveloped, and implementation applicability continues to be understudied. Despite the uncertainty around the idea, many cities globally have created distinctive visions of a smart, sustainable city. This paper developed a measurement instrument based upon a prior conceptualisation that embraced the subjective nature of the citizenry’s perceptions of a smart sustainable city. The measurement instrument was initially refined from a large statement list of 80 from the initial conceptualisation before statistically honing this instrument through exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory composite analysis. This is before applying the tool in the real-world context in various cities in Malaysia and UK. Known group validity was additionally used to verify the instrument, comparing between Malaysian and UK participants and between four different cities. A twenty-item measurement instrument consisting of four factors, Planning, Environment, Social and Smart, was developed from this study. These results support current theoretical perspectives with only minor variations from the core theory; however, this better reflects the dynamics of the smart sustainable city phenomenon. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."

The study adapted and validated indicators that can be adopted, to predict, estimate, depict and measure green city development in developing countries. In using a covariance-based structural equation model (CBSEM), the study developed a framework for green cities development in developing countries using Kumasi city (Ghana) as a case study. Design/methodology/approach: To test the proposed framework, a quantitative methodology was used, in which, data was collected using research questionnaires that targeted a sample of 200 green city experts. In total, 154 useable questionnaires were retrieved, representing a response rate of 77%. The confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses were adopted in a CBSEM. Findings: The indices reported were indicative that the model/framework is a good fit for the data. This points to the direction that the model for measuring green city development was statistically significant and acceptable. The results of the confirmatory factor analysis revealed a robust fit of the indices, as they met the standardised cut-off points and as such the model fits the data. Practical implications: This novel research is one of the few studies investigating green cities development in Ghana which could serve as a lesson for other developing countries. The proposed green city framework will serve as a guide to stakeholders in identifying the key indicators/factors that are critical to green city development in developing countries, especially Ghanaian cities.

The methodology behind DERNP is based on a randomized route sampling procedure that utilizes the Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP) in combination with the tile-based HERE Maps Traffic API v7 and a digital elevation model provided by the European Union’s Earth Observation Programme Copernicus to generate a large set of independent and realistic routes throughout OpenStreetMap road networks. By evaluating these routes using the PHEMLight5 framework, a comprehensive list of RNP parameters is estimated and translated into polynomial regression models for general usage. The applicability of these estimations is demonstrated based on a case study of four major German cities. This case study considers network characteristics in terms of detours, infrastructure, traffic congestion, fuel consumption, and CO2 emissions. Our results show that DERNP and its underlying randomized route sampling methodology overcomes major limitations of previous wide-scale RNP approaches, enabling efficient, easy-to-use, and region-specific RNP comparisons. © 2022 by the authors."

Several cities around the world have adopted the “smart city” label in recognition of these advantages. In fact, citizen engagement in public urban development and decision making has been acknowledged globally in many countries; yet, evaluations of the outcomes that allow the contribution of empowerment to be measured and compared with other influences are lacking. This study examines the correlation between stakeholder management measures (SMM) and citizen participation level (CPL) in the process of achieving an SSC. Four SMM factors were extracted from a literature review and sent out to be examined by experts in the field of built environments. Mean score (MS) ranking was used to confirm the importance of these variables in terms of predicting correlations with CPL. The results were generalised by multiple regression analysis techniques. This study shows a positive significant correlation between SMM and CPL in terms of Regulation, Collaboration, Legitimates, and Control. These four predictors make a significant contribution to escalating the levels of engagement and empowerment of citizen participation (CP). This paper contributes to knowledge in the field by identifying pillars that can increase CPL. Our findings could support the stakeholders of SSC projects to raise CPL, not only by hearing their voices but also by delegating power. © 2022 by the authors."

It not only aims to help city logistics companies sustainably decarbonize urban freight distribution but also provide valuable practical guidelines. To evaluate zero-emission LMD solutions, this article presents a novel multicriteria group decision-making methodology with dual hesitant fuzzy (DHF) sets. First, we propose some improved operations on DHF elements and investigate their vital properties. Second, based on these operations, we develop DHF improved weighted averaging operator to overcome the drawbacks of the existing operators on DHF sets. Third, for measuring the weights of criteria, a new model called the cross-entropy-based optimization model (CEBOM) is developed. Fourth, for the rational aggregation of the preferences, we formulate a new method namely score-based double normalized measurement alternatives and ranking according to the compromise solution (SDNMARCOS). The proposed DNMARCOS method couples the linear and vector normalization techniques. It is composed of the complete compensatory model and the incomplete compensatory model. Thus, SDNMARCOS is more robust compared to the available state-of-the-art approaches. To exhibit the applicability of the proposed DHF-CEBOM-SDNMARCOS methodology in real-world settings, a case study for one of the largest Austrian logistics companies in Serbia is provided. The research findings show that electric light commercial vehicles are the best LMD solution. Also, it is recommended to consider electric cargo bikes as a viable mid-term solution. The superiority of the introduced methodology is demonstrated through the comparative investigation.  © 1993-2012 IEEE."
"Sustainable city concept based on green hydrogen energy","2022","10.1016/j.scs.2022.104154","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138079407&doi=10.1016%2fj.scs.2022.104154&partnerID=40&md5=4cee76c21c6642c948bbb271fa241741","The current study investigates the green hydrogen production from renewable energy sources for the metropolitan city of Istanbul by using electrolysers. The main idea is to create a hydrogen map for every district in Istanbul, based on renewable energy sources and water splitting technology. The potentially available renewable sources, such as solar (including offshore), wind (including offshore), biomass, geothermal and underwater current are used for calculating the total hydrogen production potential. Istanbul's potential for producing green hydrogen is estimated to be 7.96 Mt. The study results show that Catalca, Şile, Silivri, Arnavutköy, and Beykoz come out as the districts with the highest green hydrogen potential with 1.49 Mt, 1.19 Mt, 1.12 Mt, 0.57 Mt, and 0.46 Mt, respectively. After supplying the necessary power demand for the city, the remaining power is used to produce green hydrogen which may contribute an economic value of over US $100 billion with a current price of $13/kg of hydrogen and 23.88 billion US$ with a targeted price of $3/kg of hydrogen, respectively. The available potentials for each district are also specifically studied and discussed. It is more importantly expected to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions by about 90% which will ve very important to achieve a carbon-neutral city and hence country due its dominated role. Furthermore, the results provide a clear guidance to enable policymakers and private sectors to use renewable energy potentials for their investment purposes or promote clean energy programs, tackling carbon-based energy consumption, pollution, and greenhouse effect. This, later on, can be used by policymakers and energy providers to help the city and local communities for achieving the United Nation's sustainable development goals. © 2022"
"Smart Sustainable Cities: The Essentials for Managers’ and Leaders’ Initiatives within the Complex Context of Differing Definitions and Assessments","2022","10.3390/smartcities5030050","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138686425&doi=10.3390%2fsmartcities5030050&partnerID=40&md5=aa310c3ec7546855b54c66bf4fc13354","This study starts by questioning what smart cities are and how they are being planned for the future of the population. Faced with a wide range of information, the coexistence of multiple definitions, and differences between the theoretical concept and what is being carried out in the real world, it is recognized that entrepreneurs and public managers require more clarity regarding the essential attributes that need to be considered in the initiatives of a city that aims to be classified as smart. This study strives to identify and synthesize essential information, helping managers to define and develop projects and initiatives within the context of smart cities. Through a literature review, six widely cited and commonly used groups of indicators are selected, and the most frequent themes, indicators, and keywords are identified. The results are the essential elements founded and synthesized in a single visual scheme. Although this study has a practical purpose, it is also necessary to promote new policies focused on incentives for local initiatives to support and complement them due to the new decentralized and anthropocentric approach to smart sustainable cities. © 2022 by the authors."

Even so, little attention has been paid to studies focused on developing countries. The aim of this study is to examine the barriers to green cities development in developing countries. Design/methodology/approach: A comprehensive literature review was conducted to examine the barriers to green cities development. In terms of methodological choice, a quantitative research strategy was used to collect data from professionals who have lines of influence on the greening of our cities and sustainable urban development. Findings: The barriers to green city development identified were lack of awareness of the benefits of a green city, environmental degradation, insufficient policy implementation efforts, excessive generation of solid waste and poor wastewater collection and treatment. It was indicative from the study findings that taking the right sustainable steps in urban development and a paradigm shift towards the pillars of sustainability, Ghanaian cities, especially Kumasi, have a great proclivity of regaining its longstanding status being “Garden City”. Practical implications: The outcome of this study provides stakeholders in city development an insight into the barriers that inhibit the development of green cities. In practice, this study contributively proposes that the concept of green cities should be incorporated in the education and training of stakeholders to improve the level of awareness.

"Understanding transport users' preferences for adopting electric vehicle based mobility for sustainable city: A moderated moderated-mediation model","2023","10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2022.103520","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85145856476&doi=10.1016%2fj.jtrangeo.2022.103520&partnerID=40&md5=aa7222f4dc952a82b347ed68accd81db","Global urban mobility projects faces multiple sustainability challenges related to the high carbon emission and gasoline consumption. Due to carbon-intensive mobility, many developed countries implemented various place-based decarbonisation (PBD) strategies to develop sustainable city environments, but the adoption of PBD strategies in developing nations is still lagging. Electric vehicles (EVs) based mobilities are considered a PBD strategy to reduce city transport externalities. In addition, developing nations' transport users have various adoption uncertainties in adopting EVs-based urban mobility. Therefore, the present study focuses on understanding transport users' preferences for adopting EVs-based mobility to promote decarbonization in multiple places in India. The proposed conceptual model is based on attribution theory to develop EVs' adoption intention and validate it with the users of different tier-1 cities of India. The PBD strategies of the considered cities differ entirely from developed cities of the world and have different EVs promotion strategies. A structured survey instrument is used to record 335 potential users' responses to validate the conceptual model. The proposed model's psychometric properties are analysed with the LISREL package of Structural Equation Modeling. The moderated-mediation model and proposed research model hypotheses are tested using PROCESS macro. The obtained results confirm two important relations; first, the EVs technical attributes mediated the relationship between users' financial attributes and psychological attributes for PBD mobility adoption; Second, financial attributes are positively related to psychological attributes for adopting EVs for users' PBD mobility. The other key finding of the research is that the financial attributes interacted with the existing EV infrastructure (first moderator) and familiarity (second moderator) to influence the technical attributes of EV adoption. Thus, the obtained results unfold the complex relationships among financial attributes, psychological attributes, technical attributes, EV infrastructure, and familiarity for developing positive intentions towards adopting EVs for city decarbonization. The above factors profoundly impact the psychological makeup of users, resulting in individuals' purchasing intention of EVs for PBD. These results contribute to sustainable development in public transportation system and paves way to decarbonise city mobility. This paper helps transport planners and city administrators to develop adeqaute policy instruments for improving decarbonization strategies in Indian cities. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"

In recognition of smart cities’ advantages, several cities have adopted smart city labels. Although citizens’ engagement in public urban development and decision-making has been acknowledged globally in many countries, evaluating the outcomes that allow citizens to contribute does not measure and compare with other factors. This study examines the impact between the citizens’ participation level (CPL) and the smart sustainable cities outcome (SSCO). Four factors were extracted from the literature review and interviews were conducted with 12 decision and policymakers to establish the importance of these factors and to suggest any other additional factors. In addition, a questionnaire survey was utilised to assess and validate the result by experts in the field of the built environment. The mean score (MS) ranking was used to confirm the importance of these predicted correlations with SSCO. Endogeneity tests and multivariate regression analysis were adopted to validate the causality between CLP and SSCO. The results suggest that a positive significant correlation exists between the CPL and SSCO. A higher CPL leads to a higher level of SSCO, but this does not apply the other way around. The four significant factors of CPL to engage and empower citizens are accountability and responsibility, transparency, participation, and inclusion. This paper contributes to knowledge by identifying the measures of CPL and SSCO that can support the implementation of SSC by understanding what can be expected from the government and decision-makers and what can be expected from the citizens. © 2023 by the authors."

Digital Twins (DTs) technology was applied to the Urban Drainage System (UDS) and solves the modeling and scheduling problems of emergency drainage through the core model construction method of DTs. Firstly, the components of the UDS that are necessary in the process of building the model were listed according to the entity elements of the five-dimensional (5D) DTs model. Then, this work analyzed the essential data of the DTs of UDS and the Data Collection method according to the data elements of the 5D DTs model. Finally, the Multi-Level Dynamic Priority and Importance Scheduling (MDPIS) algorithm was proposed based on the Fixed Priority Scheduling (FPS) algorithm, which was verified by the simulation experiment. The experimental results indicated that the MDPIS algorithm showed significant performance in the rainfall scene with large fluctuations compared with the FPS algorithm. Specifically, the average improvement ratio was the highest, reaching 49.81%; the overall improvement rate was constant at about 48%. The operation results showed an apparent correlation between the catchment parameters and the overflow loss of the pumping station. The improved MDPIS algorithm can effectively utilize the water storage capacity and drainage capacity of the pumping station and reduce overflow losses during rainfall by dynamically adjusting the priority to solve the problem of urban inland inundation. The DTs-based UDS proposed here can effectively mitigate the overflow loss and improve the working efficiency of the pumping station cluster, promoting the development of Substainable Cities. © 2022"

The proposed system is studied comprehensively and analyzed thermodynamically to identify the effectiveness of the system and its potential implementation. The current system is simulated using the Aspen Plus and Aspen HYSYS. The thermodynamic calculations are carried out by using the engineering equation solver (EES) software package. This system primarily uses solar energy to produce electricity and as an input energy to the pyrolysis reactor that converts plastic wastes to syngas. Also, the system includes a thermal storage unit to maintain the operation during low solar irradiation. The syngas produced from plastic wastes pyrolysis is processed through a combined cycle to produce electricity. The system generates the electricity at a capacity of 21,601.9 kW. The methane produced is processed through a steam reforming unit to produce hydrogen at a total rate of 0.6 kg/s. The water desalination sub-system produces fresh water through multi effect desalination at a rate of 22.95 kg/s. The energy efficiency and exergy efficiency of the overall system are found to be 62.65% and 42.30% respectively. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
"Environmental justice in a very green city: Spatial inequality in exposure to urban nature, air pollution and heat in Oslo, Norway","2023","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.160193","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141928526&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2022.160193&partnerID=40&md5=806f134d89261b4e04143917cc4e1ab2","Poorer citizens are often more exposed to environmental hazards due to spatial inequalities in the distribution of urban blue-green space. Few cities have managed to prevent spatial and social inequality despite sustainable development strategies like compact city planning. We explore whether environmental injustice exists in a city where one would least expect to find it: a city with abundant nature, an affluent population governed by a left leaning social democratic city council, and an aggressive densification strategy; Oslo, Norway. Green space was measured with a satellite-derived vegetation index which captures the combined availability of gardens, street trees, parks and forest. Blue space was defined by the proximity of residential areas to the closest lake, river or fjord. We found that poorer city districts, often with greater immigrant populations, have less available blue-green spaces and are disproportionately exposed to hazardous air pollution levels, but not extreme heat compared to wealthier city districts. Citizens living within 100 m of a water body are likely to earn US$ 20,000 more per year than citizens living 500 m away from water, and a US$ 3000 increase in annual income corresponds to a 10 % increase in green space availability. Hazardous air pollution concentrations in the poorest city districts were above levels recommended by the WHO and Oslo municipality. Historical trends showed that districts undergoing population densification coincide with the lowest availability of blue-green space, suggesting that environmental justice has been overlooked in compact city planning policy. Despite Oslo's affluence and egalitarian ideals, the patterns of inequality we observed mirror the city's historical east-west class divide and point to spatial concentration of wealth as a core factor to consider in studies of green segregation. Urban greening initiatives in Oslo and other cities should not take spatial equality for granted, and instead consider socio-economic geographies in their planning process. © 2022 The Authors"

As a result of gaps in government-funded data collection, and in the interest of promoting community engagement, there is a global movement towards consideration of nontraditional sources of data, including citizen science (CS) data. These data are particularly valuable when collected at a high resolution over large spatial extents and long time periods. CS projects and infrastructure are abundant and well documented in the Global North, while needs for participatory projects to fill environmental monitoring gaps may be greater in the Global South. The paper explores the contributions of citizen science projects originating in Africa for two Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), namely SDG 6, and SDG 11 which are particularly important to the millions of low-income residents of cities across Africa. Using a mixed methods approach that involves online surveys, interviews, expert conference panels, and a desk review, we analyze a total of 53 CS projects focusing on water, sanitation, and urban planning. The paper addresses CS in Africa and CS for SDGs, and documents evidence for participatory and CS data collection in Africa. It also describes the survey methods, including approaches to training of volunteers, sources of funding, data collection methods, and objectives of the tools and projects. Finally, it provides reflections on the challenges of integrating CS into official statistics in Africa, and some lessons learnt from CS projects in Africa. This paper recommends the establishment of an open-source database, creation of a network of CS projects for communication and collaboration, the uptake of citizen-generated data, and continuous funding for such projects in Africa. © 2023 The Author(s).

The ‘Global Benefit’ perspective to support investment decisions for sustainable cities","2023","10.3389/frsc.2023.1282748","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85177050332&doi=10.3389%2ffrsc.2023.1282748&partnerID=40&md5=8ee4a4114009e896d70d652a80a9fa74","Investment decisions on demolition and reconstruction vs. refurbishment of the existing building stock can extend beyond financial and economic criteria. However, they must involve energy savings, environmental preservation, material consumption, and waste management for sustainable cities. The regulatory framework used in the past decades and the correlated research seem more unbalanced toward the containment of building energy consumption than toward embodied energy (EE) management in production processes and environmental impact management. Foreshadowing the perspective of a more restrictive regulatory framework on EE, such as prohibiting the displacement of materials with residual energy potential, such as waste in landfills, some challenging frontier issues are involved when facing the limits of the economic evaluation methodologies for transformation projects. Thus, this study aimed to propose a reasoning and an operative modality to support urban governance policies and investment decisions involving private and public subjects in the construction sector. Circular economy and life cycle thinking principles, through life cycle costing (LCC) and life cycle assessment (LCA), are assumed and harmonized with the discounted cash-flow analysis (DCFA): (1) monetizing and modeling into the DCFA the EE and the embodied carbon (EC); (2) internalizing the Global Cost and the new ‘Global Benefit’ into the net present value (NPV) calculation; and (3) focusing on the residual end-of-life value calculation from the early design and investment decision stages. The reasoning can be extended to single buildings, the urban scale, or even entire portions of existing buildings in urban areas concerning typological sub-segments. The operative modality is yet to be explored in a concrete application for orienting urban governance policies and sustainable public–private partnerships, including environmental and, thus, social externalities even in the private real estate investment decision process, in the scope of evolving regulations.

A silver lining emerged from this global crisis, with noticeable improvements in public acoustic environments due to reduced noise levels resulting from restricted mobility. This research focuses on the acoustic environment of Thessaloniki's waterfront, a Mediterranean metropolis in Northern Greece. Waterfronts of Mediterranean coastal cities provide unique acoustic environments worthy of protection from environmental noise. By analyzing sound level measurements and recordings during the 2021 lockdown and comparing them to the post-lockdown period in 2022, we aimed to explore environmental noise and acoustic complexity indicators. The study's findings revealed a significant increase in acoustic complexity during the lockdown, underscoring an inverse relationship between noise levels and acoustic complexity. Urban waterfronts, like Thessaloniki's, hold great potential for enhancing acoustic complexity and subsequently improving the acoustic quality of public spaces while protecting them from environmental noise. This research sheds light on the possible use of sound complexity as an environmental quality standard that can be incorporated in sustainable urban planning and design.  © 2023 the author(s), published by De Gruyter."

The eco-city is one of such concepts which emphasises the role of hydrological resources, especially small-scale retention, in environmentally- and user-friendly spatial development. Pro-environmental concepts are manifested mainly as provisions reflecting the above principles in the strategic documents of cities. The aim of this article was to verify the hypothesis postulating that in “Studies of the Conditions and Directions of Spatial Development” (SCaDSD) [in Polish: “Studia uwarunkowań i kierunków zagospodarowania przestrzennego” – SUiKZP], which are the fundamental strategic documents for Polish cities, the approach to small-scale retention is diverse and often insufficient from the “eco-city” perspective. To achieve the research goal, SCaDSDs were analysed in a comparative study (7,061 data records for spatial planning and small-scale retention were analysed). The study demonstrated that in SCaDSDs, small-scale retention solutions are diversified both quantitatively and qualitatively, which may hinder the implementation of the eco-city concept in terms of small-scale retention. SCaDSDs focus primarily on the protective and cleansing roles of retention, including protection against flood risk and access to clean water which is a basic human need. SCaDSDs should offer a multi-functional approach to retention and thus fully implement “eco-city” principles. This is a particularly important consideration because the role of strategic planning documents is to provide up-to-date directions for the sustainable development for modern cities. © 2023 Publisher of the University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn.

The massive incentives provided by the Italian government for sustainable building, in view of the post-pandemic economic recovery, risk being reduced to mere support for the real estate sector, which turns the financial transfer from the public into an increase in asset value for the private sector. Such an incentive system could contradict the original function of the city, which is to be the privileged place for social communication and the creation of the identity of settled communities. A process of property development that disregards the distribution of income favors the most valuable property, thus increasing the socioeconomic distance between centrality and marginality. The latter is a condition that often characterizes the parts of the historic city affected by extensive phenomena of physical and functional obsolescence of the built heritage, and it is less capable of attracting public funding. The increase of building decay and social filtering-down accelerates the loss and involution of neighborhood identities; the latter constitutes the psycho-social energy that helps preserve the physical, functional and anthropological integrity of the city, due to the differences that make its parts recognizable. This study, with reference to a neighborhood in the historic city of Syracuse (Italy), proposes a model of analysis, evaluation and planning of interventions on the buildings’ roofs, aimed at defining the best strategy for ecological–environmental regeneration. The model presented allows one to generate a multiplicity of alternative strategies that combine different uses of roofs: from the most sustainable green roofs, but that are less cost-effective from the identity and landscape point of view; to the most efficient photovoltaic roofs from the energy–environmental point of view; and up to the most cost-effective ones, the vertical extensions with an increase in building volume. The proposed tool is an inter-scalar multidimensional valuation model that connects the multiple eco-socio-systemic attitudes of individual buildings to the landscape, identity, energy–environmental and economic overall dimensions of the urban fabric and allows one to define and compare multiple alternative recovery hypotheses, evaluating their potential impacts on the built environment. The model allows the formation of 100 different strategies, which are internally coherent and differently satisfy the above four perspectives, and it provides the preferable ones for each of the five approaches practiced. The best strategy characterizes most green roofs, 427 out of 1075 building units, 277 blue roofs, 121 green–blue roofs and 46 grey roofs. © 2022 by the authors."

The tool measures EP over time and helps to explain possible factors contributing to the variation of the EPs in the studied time. The GCAP uses the EP results to develop a green city action plan to improve the current EP for a given period. Both tool and method fulfil gaps found in the green city literature, contain innovative approaches, and help cities to measure and plan improvements in their current EP. By ap-plying the EP tool to ten Asian cities in two periods (2007–2009 and 2015–2018), the paper shows that Singapore and Hong Kong had the highest EPs and Bangalore had the lowest. Implementation of water management and climate change strategies are some factors explaining the im-provement in Hong Kong’s EP. A strong increase in population size is behind the EP reduction in Bangalore. The Manila GCAP proposes to improve the current EP of the city from 15.43 to 17.41 in twelve years. © 2022 Brilhante and Skinner."

In recent years, 'smart city' has been a buzzword. As each fad emerges, urbanists debate its meaning and implications. However, why so many urban concepts circulate at all is rarely focused on. This study attempts to answer this question based on the Marxian view of the built environment as a fixed capital. We focus on the differences between the built environment and other types of fixed capital, and show how these differences render capital circulation in the built environment sector more fragile. We claim that such fragility cannot be fixed within the circuit of capital, so external intervention is necessary and deployment of catchy urban concepts is a resorted method of such intervention. © 2023 The Author(s).

The goal is to determine the feasibility of sustainable green infrastructure for roads. The new park area on the road is approximately 83,000 sq. meters and there are approximately 3349 trees planted in the park. These trees can store 77.68 metric tons of carbon annually, isolate 13.21 metric tons of total carbon, remove 70.446 kg of air pollutants, avoid 112.8 cubic meters of emissions, and mitigate 31,983.90 cubic feet of emissions. The resulting economic value is approximately 874,494 dollars. Road green infrastructure conversion can be a useful solution to respond to environmental problems. To promote decision-making when developing policies, a process of pre-verification with quantified data of ecosystem services (example: air quality benefits, etc.) of trees using the i-Tree Eco program is required. In the execution stage, it is possible to understand the structure, function, and value of green spaces and prepare guidelines for tree selection, design alternatives, and evaluation as one of the management strategies for green spaces to improve the value of ecosystem services. © 2023 by the authors."

However, data on the amounts of household-generated waste are lacking in many regions. Uncertainties in the amounts and fractions of biowaste make it challenging to manage actions that reduce its environmental impacts and generate value. The current observational study sought to quantify and characterize the household waste generated in the green city of Benguerir. To achieve this objective, we surveyed waste generation rates in 68 randomly selected households. The results showed that, on average, 0.69 kg of waste was generated per person per day. An average of 80% of the household-generated waste was biowaste, which, if managed appropriately, represents a valuable source of plant nutrients. We estimated that shifting from the current landfill disposal of biowaste to its utilization for compost and biogas production will result in up to an 88% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. These findings suggest that managing household waste will be vital for reducing city-wide carbon emissions and simultaneously creating employment in the waste management sector. © 2023 by the authors."

Due to the global energy crisis, climate warming and other issues, low-carbon eco-cities have become the general trend. In the context of this study, we aim to solve problems of resource-exhausted cities, which are in urgent need for green transformation. The selection of research objects is mostly based on representative regions (eastern, middle. and western regions) in China, which will lead to significant regional characteristics in eco-city planning. On the basis of the index selection, construction of the evaluation index system and calculation on the coordinated development degree of industrial structure and urbanization, we explore the coordination relationship between industrial transformation and urbanization level with the time span of three-time nodes (2005, 2010, 2015), which were also the speed-up of industrialization and urbanization in China. Results indicate that the transformation and upgrading of the current regional industrial structure is lagging behind, and the internal power of industrial upgrading is insufficient, which limits the ecological development of resource-exhausted cities. It can also be found that the coordinated development index of urbanization and industrial structure is too low. The main implications of this study state that resource-exhausted cities are still in the state of being on the verge of imbalance and still have a wide development space based on the division standard. Furthermore, compared to the rationalization industrial structure, this study indicates the contributive rate of industrial structure supererogation to the overall level of urbanization is bigger. Countermeasures about the urban environment from the ecology stratification plane and how the cities achieve the urban form of sustainable development as a complex organism are also proposed. Scientific analysis and discussion on resource-cities by studying and solving related problems on the eco-city’s construction has vital significance to urbanization and sustainable development, which can reflect the relationship between industry, city, and ecology. © 2022 by the authors."

Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based CAV solutions play significant roles in sustainable cities. The convergence imposes stringent security requirements for CAV safety and reliability. In practice, vehicles are developed with increased automation and connectivity. Increased automation increases the reliance on the sensor-based technologies and decreases the reliance on the driver; increased connectivity increases the exposures of vehicles’ vulnerability and increases the risk for an adversary to implement a cyber-attack. Much work has been dedicated to identifying the security vulnerabilities and recommending mitigation techniques associated with different sensors, controllers, and connection mechanisms, respectively. However, there is an absence of comprehensive and in-depth studies to identify how the cyber-attacks exploit the vehicles’ vulnerabilities to negatively impact the performance and operations of CAVs. In this survey, we set out to thoroughly review the security issues introduced by AV and CV technologies, analyze how the cyber-attacks impact the performance of CAVs, and summarize the solutions correspondingly. The impact of cyber-attacks on the performance of CAVs is elaborated from both viewpoints of intra-vehicle systems and inter-vehicle systems. We pointed out that securing the perception and operations of CAVs would be the top requirement to enable CAVs to be applied safely and reliably in practice. Additionally, we suggested to utilize cloud and new AI methods to defend against smart cyber-attacks on CAVs. © 2022 by the authors."

As stated by United Nations’ report on 1983, “Policies to meet the challenge of a growing, healthier and more active seniors population -based on the view of the ageing of society as an opportunity to be utilized -automatically benefit the individual ageing person, materially and otherwise. Similarly, any effort to ameliorate the quality of life for the seniors, and to meet their diverse social and cultural needs, enhances their capacity to continue interacting with society”. Aging society provides not only a new context, but a new opportunity to rethink our traditional views of age. The growing number of seniors people will soon make the majority of overall population. As noticed by reports of international organizations, cities will play a more important role in dealing with these quantitative and cultural changes, mostly because it is expected that a quarter of the population over 60 will be concentrating in the central areas of compact cities. In brief, cities are at once growing and aging at an incredible speed. Although aging process represents a fundamental and structural phenomenon with very deep consequences at economic, social and political level, and with an impact on the individual one as on the society as whole, our cities should deal with this process and respond, in terms of public health and social care, to needs of older people, also those that will experience a loss of autonomy. It is important to note that there are a greater heterogeneity within older population in terms of conditions and demands, which depend on their specific personal, social and familial context. Urban space - in its complex differentiation between public space, third space, and private space - represents both a tool and a strategic factor in pursuing the objective of ensuring high levels of widespread well-being and, from a political perspective, fully shaping the right to the city for seniors individuals.

It focuses on two case studies–Steve Bloom’s photobook, Trading Places: The Merchants of Nairobi (2009) and the first issue of the Kenyan literary magazine Kwani? (2003). These are compared to the collectively performed poem ‘Mistaken Identity’ (2019) by a group of poets from the neighbourhood of Kayole, to show that the street aesthetics in the two cases rest on distance, while the meaning-making in the poem rests on proximity. Distance in this context takes several forms, such as the gap between socio-economic classes and actual physical distance, but I register it on the level of epistemology. The poem also articulates a form of epistemological proximity between, first, the forms of meaning-making that can be seen in both the text and the visual and performative components of the video, and, second, the place that is portrayed. Rather than arguing that proximity is preferable to distance as a basis of meaning-making, this article attempts to theorize the emergence of a specific aesthetic. This aesthetic presents itself as an aesthetic because the particular forms of social stratification and concomitant social distance between communities and neighbourhood (which have emerged in Nairobi since 2000) allow an economic, political and cultural elite to re-discover the city, which they experience as simultaneously strange and familiar. © 2022 The Author(s).

Various filter media, natural and engineered materials, have been used to amend the LID solutions in field experiments enhancing the removal of different contaminants present in storm water of different kinds. Researchers suggest locally available low-cost media having high capacity to remove pollutants. Other parameters to take into consideration when selecting filter media are clogging, hydraulic parameters.

The emergence of green cities may provide a promising venue to address cities’ environmental degradation and citizens’ disengagement with current socio-environmental issues, thus giving rise to the notion of Environmental Citizenship (EC). Despite these assumptions, empirical research on the topic is currently emerging. In this study, we examine citizens’ engagement in green cities and its interrelatedness with EC through a systematic literature review. The selected empirical studies (n = 25) were published in peer-reviewed journals during the timespan of the last 12 years (2010–2021). In total, 31 green cities were analyzed in the 25 selected empirical studies. Thematic and frequency analysis revealed that green cities encourage citizens’ engagement with the implemented green policies, while also advancing citizens’ EC. Furthermore, correlational analysis between citizens’ engagement and the Education for Environmental Citizenship (EEC) model revealed that citizens’ engagement with the implemented green policies fosters citizens’ knowledge, skills, attitudes, values, and behaviors, fueling the undertaking of various EC actions. Importantly, green cities have also proved successful in achieving EC’s outcomes leading to sustainability. © 2022 by the authors."

The authors argue that a necessary step to enable meaningful sustainable urban development is to rethink the way in which “value” and “value creation” are being interpreted in urban development policies and city branding narratives. Design/methodology/approach: Mixed-methods case study of New York City’s (NYC) urban development and city branding strategies (2007–2019) combining analysis of academic and grey literature on NYC’s urban development and city branding, value hierarchies in NYC urban development strategic plans and local media reports covering NYC’s development and branding processes. Findings: Despite claiming commitment to urban sustainability, NYC’s urban development and branding narratives reveal a clear dominance of interpreting “value” primarily as “exchange value”, thus prioritising economic growth. Research limitations/implications: In the authors’ view, a systemic, systematic and structured approach to generating “sustainability value” is necessary if city branding is to become a governance tool to support sustainable urban development. A “tetravaluation” approach is recommended as a practical, structured framework that can bridge across the ideas of “sustainability value” and “pluralistic governance”, ensuring effective implementation. Further investigation in additional urban contexts is required. Originality/value: The research contributes to current scholarly debates towards more balanced and pluralistic conceptions of “value” and place branding as a more holistic, participatory and democratic governance model for sustainable urban development. © 2022, Laura Ripoll Gonzalez and Fred Gale."

The purpose of this research is to investigate the adoption of an Urban Services Technology (UST) in tourism management within a tourism-oriented small town in Southern Italy. A questionnaire was then constructed according to the 12-variable Urban Service Technology Acceptance Model (USTAM), and 216 responses were obtained from a defined group of 1076 subjects. Analyzing the data with a quantitative approach by conducting Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), the assumptions of the initial model were all rejected and new five factors emerged. The path diagram shows that only the factors Sustainability, Ease and Value have a positive correlation with technology adoption.

This oversight is of concern because research carried out in the last 20+ years indicates artificial light at night (ALAN) in cities, and the light pollution this generates can have negative consequences on human health and well-being and the entire environment, including ecosystems and the flora and fauna that inhabit them. By applying a literature review, analysis and synthesis method, this work offers a new perspective on lighting and a timeline of key events that established ALAN and light pollution awareness in different disciplines and professional groups connected to urban illumination. It also identifies three fundamental aspects which require further transdisciplinary research and the translation of this knowledge into practice in order to enable the development of sustainable cities and communities at night. Finally, it presents in detail a new, theoretical environment-centred design framework for responsible urban illumination, with four iterative design phases, in order to help guide various stakeholders in cities, along with a four-level pyramid model that can be applied to urban illumination in the form of principles, processes, practices, and tools.

Therefore, the demand for energy saving and diversified personal thermal management requires innovative solutions combining advanced building materials and structural designs to provide personal thermal comfort during indoor and outdoor activities. However, due to the complexities of structural designs and their associated materials, analytical and numerical strategies are for revealing real-world scenarios are limited. Therefore, full-scale experiments are required for exploring and demonstrating dynamic scenarios under thermal stress. This study aimed to explore the feasibility of using drone along with various thermal image analysis software that enables thermal photogrammetric mapping for monitoring and classification of heat rates based on building components surveyed across the UAEU campus. Thermal aerial images were collected in March 2022 and analyzed using SPSS, Agisoft Metashape Professional, DJI Thermal Tool, and FLIR for two buildings, A and B, and pedestrian spaces across UAEU's main campus in shaded, unshaded, and green zones. Noramilty and Kruskal-Wallis H tests were applied to examine if there was a statistically significant variation in surface temperatures. The pedestrian space thermal analysis showed that the natural shaded grass surface has the most tolerable heat environment (mean rank = 7.6), while the unshaded sand surface has the most unfriendly thermal environment (mean rank = 52.0), with an 18°C difference in mean surface temperature.

Smart city projects can offer citizens an opportunity to understand how they contribute to their city's sustainability. Furthermore, an interactive smart city system can create synergies that benefit both the citizens and the city itself. This paper presents the Green Bear smart city platform, an IoT Human-in-the-Loop system that uses LoRaWAN nodes to gather information on city green spaces, bike lanes, and recycling depots. A user-centered mobile application that allows for active user participation, feedback, and incentivization is used to close the loop with humans. This system allows citizens to evaluate their participation in aspects that improve the city's sustainability through a gamification scheme, obtaining points for different activities in the city's public spaces and personal activities to improve their quality of life. This solution is being implemented in the city of Coimbra, Portugal. After an overview of the system, the paper describes each main system module. The Green Bear prototype was subject to functional and technological assessment, and the results are presented and discussed. © 2022 The Author(s)"

However, there is a lack of investigation into the potential relationship between social mentality and health, as well as of the comparison between different databases worldwide and in China, in the current context of COVID-19. Hence, the aim of this paper is to explore the research hotspots and development trends of social mentality and health in China and worldwide, while improving people’s health, building a sustainable society, and facilitating the achieving of the SDGs. A bibliometric method is employed in this paper from a macro-quantitative and micro-qualitative perspective to explore the research hotspots and trends of social mentality and health in the world and China from the two databases, namely the English-language Web of Science (WOS) and the Chinese-language China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). The results indicate that: (1) By using keyword co-occurrence and clustering analysis via the CiteSpace software bibliometric tool, 11 current research hotspots have been identified and studies are increasing in terms of using the Chinese language and the English language. (2) The current studies in the CNKI database mainly focus on the macro social environmental factors affecting social mentality and population research, while the studies in the WOS database pay more attention to social mentality and health in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic situation and a variety of professions. Hence, future research could explore the influencing factors and cultivation methods toward a healthy social mentality from the perspective of methodology and toward achieving SDG 3, providing healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages, and SDG 11, building sustainable cities and communities in the post-pandemic COVID-19 era. © 2022 by the authors."

We note that the existing works on analyzing the secrecy performance of WP-BackComs have largely ignored the spatial randomness of nodes that is used to model a large-scale network. To fill this gap, this paper evaluates the secrecy outage probability of the large-scale WP-BackComs based on a tractable framework of stochastic geometry (SG). In particular, the imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC) at each gateway (GW) and eavesdropper (Eve), and the non-linear energy harvesting (EH) model and energy-causality constraint at each backscatter user (BU) are considered. The energy outage probability and secrecy outage probability expressions are derived in the general case at first, then the closed-form expressions are obtained under the special scenario, i.e., the no-noise and the typical propagation loss scenario. Numerical simulations validate the analytical results and examine the impacts of various parameters on the secrecy performance. In particular, there exists an optimal reflection coefficient for secrecy outage probability minimization under certain conditions, and the optimal reflection coefficient increases with the increasing SIC coefficient at GW. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"

It directly affects the quality of urban economies toward efficiency and innovation with minimal resource consumption. This requires the use of appropriate SDSS (Spatial Decision Support Systems) which take into account inclusive approaches to engage local stakeholders. The study aims at developing an interactive dashboard to aid decision-makers in sustainable urban planning processes to co-create future transition strategies with the employment of spatialized outputs. The dashboard enables the evaluation of the sustainability performance of the city by the selection and assessment of KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) as a part of the MOLOC European Interreg Project. The study proposes a multidisciplinary GIS-based framework for the spatial evaluation of KPIs which can support scenario development by providing targeted suggestions for local development planning. Outcomes represent a useful interactive SDSS tool within a storytelling dashboard which is combinable with multi-criteria decision models at the city scale. The spatial distribution of results evidences the strengths and weaknesses of the city and facilitates the implementation of low-carbon action plans, avoiding unnecessary investments. The methodology illustrated was applied to the city of Turin as the case study, however, it can be implemented in other European urban contexts intending to achieve sustainable spatial planning since the methodological framework modulates to the territorial specificities of a place, always including all aspects of sustainability to be assessed. © 2022"

Sensory gardens are one of the innovative forms of urban green zones. They implement intensive and concentrative interaction of citizens with nature, positively influencing objective and subjective human well-being. In the first part of the research, we analyzed the history of the evolution of the concept of a sensory garden from its mono-sensory to multi-sensory form using the bibliographic analysis. The results of the analyses of scientific publications were confirmed by the results of a survey presented in the second part of the research. The survey was conducted in Moscow, Saint-Petersburg, and Yekaterinburg, where 215 citizens spoke about the sensory garden. The research results confirm that the sensory gardens are a prospective form of urban green zones for citizens, and they are interested in the development of its multisensory concept. According to survey results, the zones of smells and colors in the sensory garden were the most attractive for the respondents.

Urban economies, social justice, and sustainable transportation may be impacted by pedestrianization. Certainly, pedestrianization and walkability can significantly reduce traffic congestion in historic and downtown districts. Concerning historical urban attitudes and relevant potentials, this paper proposes reconstructions to build better pedestrian areas in historic places where private car traffic and public transport lanes are also considered in pathway construction. As a case study, a historic area in the Iranian city of Kerman has been studied due to its unique cultural and climatic conditions. Consequently, all guidelines and regulations for changes to potential streets of historical districts into pedestrian zones have been carefully reviewed followed by defining scenarios of walkability and non-walkability (turning historic passageways into new roadways) of streets as well as improving traffic conditions. In addition to investigating variables including costs, traffic enhancement, and urban development priorities, the analysis has been done by performing the analytical hierarchy process (AHP). The results indicated that non-walkability-based scenarios (passage and roadway widening) could merely reduce delays while incurring significant expenses and the highest destruction of historic districts. Nevertheless, the analysis carried out using three criteria showed that walkability and the development of public transportation could provide the most reliable solutions (the highest point) to secure sustainable transportation. © 2020 American Physical Society."

Second, I use Marx’s species being to demonstrate how globalization-induced displacement estranges labor from itself and spaces in which labor produces existence. I provide two empirical moments, green city-New Town, Kolkata and the globalizing city-Ahmedabad in India to explore how urban policy fails to fundamentally alter nature–society relationship or eradicate estrangement of labor from itself, labor from nature, and nature from itself.

The cooling fluids assessed in this system were distilled water, Al2O3 0.1%, and Al2O3 0.2% based nanofluids. Tests were accomplished at diverse coolant mass flow rate in India's summer days of 2018. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) investigation was carried out to perform a parametric study, identify surface and exit T profiles, and examine the cooling effectiveness. The impact of mass flow rate of nanofluid on the outside T and Reynolds number were studied. The Reynolds number obtained in the flow experiments and CFD analysis was in the range of 900-1,300. The maximum irreversibility occurred while using water, whereas minimum irreversibility obtained Al2O3 0.2% nanofluid. Exergy efficiency was found to be increased from 20% to 36% during the day. It was identified that the increase in PV/T scheme led to higher exergy losses. The thermal efficiency of a water-based cooling system resulted in 53.61%.

Its rapid escalation and ever-increasing intensity have been felt worldwide, leading to dramatic impacts globally. The aftermath of climate change in India has brought about a profound transformation in India's environmental, socio-economic, and urban landscapes. In 2019, India ranked seventh, among the most affected countries by extreme weather events caused due to changing climate. This impact was evident in terms of both, the human toll with 2,267 lives lost, and the economic damage, which accounted for 66,182 million US$ Purchasing power parities (PPPs). Over the recent years, India has experienced a significant increase in the number and frequency of extreme weather events, causing vulnerable communities. The country experienced severe air pollution problems in several metropolitan cities and was highlighted in the list of the world's most polluted cities. Additionally, India has become the most populous nation globally, boasting a population of 1.4 billion people, equating to ~18% of the global population, and experiencing an increased rate of consumption of natural resources.

When developed as planned, it could be an example for designing future cities. However, little is known of how accessible it could be in spite of its unique design. Conversely, accessibility, as a conceptual and operational definition, has gone through several iterations. However, it still remains an often misunderstood and poorly defined and measured construct. Masdar City, as planned, consists of several types of sustainable transportation options including walking, biking, personal rapid transit (PRT), group rapid transit (GRT), bus/light rapid transit, and metro. The hierarchical additive approach (considering both spatial analysis and the time-based analysis), reports that majority of Masdar City has low accessibility to the regional metro station. Also, the result indicates that more than half of the city will need between 13.1 to 25 minutes, with an average of 15 minutes, to reach the metro station. In all, the city has medium accessibility to the metro station with opportunities to enhance the overall accessibility. Elimination of transit stops that are redundant can reduce the headway and stalling time and hence the total travel time. Also, by locating new transit stops (bus, PRT or LRT) in grids where access to closest public transit is more than 400 m by walking can help balance the capital cost of infrastructure (public transit) while improving the accessibility to the regional metro for its residents.

Future urban development planning aims to integrate the principles of the environment, economy, resources, and social justice. This paper reviews the journey of implementing the green city concept worldwide. It formulates new information about the position/achievement of green city performance, especially in “medium cities” what is interesting is that it creates new discourses for researchers and practitioners about the city, especially in “medium-scale cities”. We found that successfully implementing green cities in America and the rest of Europe still has to improve performance. Countries in Asia and Africa find it difficult to meet all the attributes of a green city. Important issues that need to be considered for the study of green cities are technological innovation, green economy, and environmental control for environmentally friendly industries. Second, focus on assessing green cities in medium-scale cities, and third, model green city development strategies so that the city meets all aspects of sustainability. The performance of green city development in “medium-scale cities” is still very low; only 2 of the eight attributes of green cities are defined (AGCI). The logical consequence is the need to give special attributes to “medium cities”; therefore, research on the setting of green city attribute standards specifically for “medium cities” is interesting to study. © IJASEIT is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International License."

As heavy contributors to climate change, pollution and the generation of waste, cities have been urged to embark on a transition to progressively become more sustainable. However, while efforts are being focused on transforming urbanism to face this challenge, urbanists are not sufficiently questioning the economic barometers they rely on. In an attempt to explain that making cities sustainable cannot emerge from relying on paradigms that create un-sustainability in the first place, this article suggests that insights from alternative approaches to economics (such as ecological economics) and to urban planning (that view cities as ecosystems) could help in understanding better what a transition toward sustainable cities could mean. Since jeopardized food security emerged from the recent Covid crisis as one of the main shortcomings of our globalized economic systems, the discussion places food systems at the core of the transition toward sustainable cities. What is suggested here is that, in the current context of a post-Covid, rapidly urbanizing and fighting climate change world, urbanists might find in the “oikonomia” etymological origin of economics (i.e., economics as “the management of resources to meet the needs of the household”) a better source of inspiration than in its other etymological origin of “chrematistike” (“economics as the art of generating monetary wealth”) to contribute to the type of advances in urbanism that are urgently needed.

These problems have caused a lot of waste of resources, which is not conducive to sustainable development. Cities waste a lot of energy at will, not only aggravating environmental pollution, but also hindering the normal life of residents and urban development. Scientifically and accurately measuring urban energy efficiency, understanding the current status and changing trends of urban energy efficiency in China, and clarifying differences in urban energy efficiency are important for improving urban energy utilization. In this paper, soft computing is used to further study the factors that affect energy efficiency, and it is reasonable to clarify the direction of energy efficiency improvement, which plays an important role in improving urban energy efficiency and formulating energy policies. In this article, we will analyze land use. Construction is a long-term and complex system project. This is a summary of past social and economic development experiences and lessons, and a corresponding strategic choice under the premise of redefining the relationship between environment and development. Therefore, before implementation, strategic environmental assessment must control the emergence of environmental problems from the very beginning, which will have important theoretical and practical significance. Policy assessment, as a form of strategic environmental assessment, accounts for most of the cases that have been implemented. Through the research of soft computing, this paper applies it to the energy utilization of green cities. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

The regenerative approach is to think of urban green space as a productive landscape, a source of food, and a support for biodiversity. In this approach, the so-called urban wastelands have a positive significance. Urban agriculture (UA) has become a commonly discussed topic in recent years with respect to sustainable development. Therefore, the combination of urban fabric and local food production is crucial for ecological reasons. The key issues are the reduction of food miles and the demand for processed food, the production of which strains the natural environment. At the same time, UA enables regeneration and restoration. An original methodological approach was used in the study following the mixed-method research concept: literature survey, case studies, and comparative analysis of objects. A review of UA architecture (UAA) projects was carried out to supplement the knowledge acquired during the bibliometric analysis. In sum, 25 existing projects, including allotment gardens, community gardens, and urban farms in the global north, were compared in this study. As a result of the analyses carried out, the breakdown of urban agriculture was developed into the following categories: (i) architectural–urban, (ii) ecological, (iii) social, and (iv) economic, including the impact of UA on physical activity and social interaction. UA is also a factor shaping the urban landscape. In conclusion, agrarian practice in urban environments has led to the creation of a new type of space, known as UAA. Production in the context of UA exceeds private goods, such as food produced for sale or for individual use. Additional goods include public goods. The review shows that UA fulfills economic, social, and environmental functions, thus falling under the concept of sustainable development. © 2022 by the authors."

However, it is possible to observe a lack, acknowledged by the scientific debate, of effective implementation of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In this context, the paper intends to contribute to addressing this gap in methodological and operational terms, focusing on SDG11, and more specifically on two of its targets: 11.1 (Affordable Housing) and 11.3 (Inclusive and Sustainable Urbanization). In this sense, the research focuses on cities as crucial points of intervention to tackle global challenges since they represent the places with greatest concentration of population. This paper proposes a new set of indicators for monitoring targets 11.1 and 11.3 of SDG11 capable of supporting public policymakers in observing the Italian territory. More specifically, the research provides: i) the state of the art of the existing indicators of the targets in analysis; ii) the selection criteria and gaps to be considered for reviewing indicators; iii) the modalities of implementation; iv) a new set of indicators to support the development of urban policies. © 2023, Dei Tipografia del Genio Civile.

The link between balanced urban growth and ESs is critical for sustainable urban development. The study followed pluralist approach for evaluating and comparing the land-cover-based economic assessment of sustainable, moderately sustainable, and unsustainable cities. The artificial intelligence-based future land cover changes were evaluated using geographic future land use simulation software with geographic information system. A case-specific modification of value coefficients for computing ecosystem service value (ESV) was applied on case cities. A workable scale was developed by exploring relation of ESs and built-up of three extreme cases. The scale has different combinations of ESs and built-up from worst to best scenario with related ESV changes for optimal utilization of land. The scale helped to assess the spatial resource and natural capital balance of any area. The results showed that the ideal ratio of ESs and built-up density range for balanced sustainable development is between 1.35 and 3.64 with ESVs between INR 10.00 million/hectare and INR 8.45 million/hectare, respectively. On applying the scale, the results showed that only 25% of the city peripheral area comes under ideal range.

Challenge-Based Learning (CBL) can support interdisciplinary collaboration on sustainability issues. It requires students to actively explore, discuss, reflect on and integrate information and methods from various disciplines. Online learning could enhance interdisciplinary collaboration since it is associated with greater geographical and educational flexibility and accessibility. Applying an active learning approach such as CBL in an online setting is believed to support interdisciplinary learning and collaboration. We present a case study that took place in a 10-week online interdisciplinary, inter-university undergraduate course on sustainability education. Our research is based on well-known online learning theories “Transactional distance” and “Community of Inquiry” (CoI). The aim of this study was to investigate how transactional distance, presence and (online) interdisciplinary learning are perceived by students. 23 undergraduate students from three universities were enrolled in the course. Quantitative survey data (N = 13) and qualitative data from student reflection papers and interviews (N = 15) were collected. Students perceived low levels of transactional distance and high levels of presence. Unexpectedly, a small increase in perceived distance between students was measured which could be explained by reported limitations of the course design. Students valued the open, interactive and creative character of the course and the online format was not perceived as hindering. Students reflected on interdisciplinary competences that they developed during the course. This study is a first step towards future national as well as international interdisciplinary, inter-university educational collaboration on sustainability issues. © 2023 The Author(s).

One of the main functions of PPP projects is to attract private capital to provide better public services and infrastructure. PPP projects require government investment, potentially threatening the debt of local governments. However, few scholars have shown attention to the relationship between PPP projects and local government debt. (2) Methods: Therefore, this study selects data from 36 cities in China from 2014 to 2018. Ordinary least squares (OLS), quantile regression, and placebo tests are used to investigate this claim. (3) Results: This study finds that PPP projects can affect local governments’ debt; based on this result, this study further proposes that the effect of PPP projects on local government debt has regional heterogeneity. Compared with eastern regions, PPPs in central and western areas of China have a noticeable impact on local government debt. This study also investigates the effect of different types of PPP projects on local government debt. In terms of the number of new additions, comprehensive urban development PPP projects have the largest effect on the exacerbation of government deb. In terms of the amount of new investment, environmental protection PPP projects have the greatest exacerbating effect on government debt. (4) Conclusion: These findings try to identify PPPs’ effect on local government debt. It is of potential reference for sustainable cities and helps to provide better transport, environmental, and health public services. © 2022 by the authors."

Industry requires different types of sources to provide several outputs, so the goal of this research was to fulfill the industrial requirement with optimization. The multigeneration cycle supplies enough power to satiate energy demands, i.e., power, cooling, hydrogen, air conditioning, freshwater, hot water, and heating. For this, the multigeneration cycle was modeled in the Engineering Equation Solver (EES) and Simulink to obtain optimized results for the industry. Energy and exergy for the multigeneration cycle were determined to assess the performance of the cycle and to investigate the optimized results for the overall system. This study shows that for configuration selection and design, different thermodynamic, economic, and environmental aspects should be considered. Based on the results, the selection of the best location for this multigeneration system was made. Power output from the wind turbine was around 7 MW and from biogas 0.6 MW. The overall exergy efficiency of the multigeneration system was found to be 0.1401. © 2023 by the authors."

Current debates around food call for a better understanding of the relationship between global and local food production and social and environmental justice. Specifically, discussions on urban greening concepts are considering whether and how social justice and sustainability goals can be achieved. This has become a pressing issue due to a growing awareness of negative effects and social imbalances in the production, consumption, and disposal of food. The article explores the normative foundations and constructions of “good and just food” that are considered appropriate to a sustainable food system and the power techniques related to personal and environmental responsibility that feature in the work of the German food policy councils seeking to initiate a transformation process. Using a governmentality approach based on Foucault, this article seeks to fill gaps in the literature regarding food policy councils and, thereby, contribute to our understanding of the local manifestations of global policy projects that address environmental and social justice in green cities. © 2023 by the author(s)."

However, the relationship between ecological space and people's perception of cultural ecosystem services (CES) is still unclear. This research investigated the current situation of the ecological space within the core area of Beijing (CAB) and explored people's use habits and their levels of CES perception. Results showed that (1) the most frequently used ecological space was the community-level ecological space. However, so far, its provision was highly lacking; (2) Residents living along the central axis of Beijing tended to perceive a higher level of CES. However, the overall perceived value of education had the lowest scores in the CAB; (3) Among them, the “cultural values” perception was significantly affected by the spatial vicinity of ecological space with historical value. The proper conservation development of historical ecological space and improved residents’ accessibility can be effective methods to promote CES perceptions of the residents in the core area.

Sustainable Development Goal 12 (SDG12), responsible consumption and production, is one of the most relevant SDGs for building Sustainable Cities. This study is based on the analysis of the implementation of SDG12 in cities, starting from universities as laboratories or first examples of sustainability. Methods: The study was carried out through a multilevel scale approach. A systematic review of the literature (global scale) of the last 5 years (2018–2022) was conducted. An analysis of the program and the initiatives of a Higher Education Institution (Tecnologico de Monterrey) is presented (local scale). Finally, a survey was applied to Faculty at this University (micro-scale). Results: The systematic review indicated that the main themes or aspects addressed in SDG12 by higher education institutions were sustainable food, supply chains, community, infrastructure, technology, policies, energy consumption, the collaborative economy, smart cities, and curricula. The local scale analysis highlighted the Distrito Tec project, 37 institutional initiatives, and 26 courses directly related to SDG12. The survey showed that 8% of Faculty considered SDG12 the most important of the SDGs and stated that this goal is necessary to reduce environmental impacts. As the most significant impact that Universities can have on SDG12, 52% of the Faculty consider that Universities should become living labs in the transition toward sustainable cities, followed by 36% who think it would be better to implement operational facilities. Discussion: The diverse contributions of the HEIs at the three scales were classified into six categories: culture, mitigation, adaptation, education, research, and outreach. The study indicates that SDG 12 has been achieved by universities in different ways, which overlaps widely with the performance of other SDGs. Results demonstrate that following a multistakeholder approach, international collaborations between HEIs can foster technology-driven multi-disciplinary research projects to consolidate sustainable cities. Building capacity to accelerate the transition of universities into urban living labs will promote climate action among the students who enroll every year.

The depictions of cities in the Hebrew Bible largely underwrite this paradigm. Third Isaiah's vision of Jerusalem, however, imagines a space that challenges these engrained ideas of the urban. Conducting a cognitive ecostylistic analysis and drawing on insights from Conceptual Metaphor Theory and Text World Theory, this article examines the green city as imagined by Third Isaiah (Isaiah 56-66). Throughout the vision, the prophet creates a new (text-) world defined by urban and natural world-builders, a blend that unites seemingly paradoxical elements. The utopian character of future Jerusalem is downplayed by its grounding in the real world (both the discourse-world and its near-equivalent, the empty text-world in which the prophecy is uttered). Third Isaiah calls for a view of city space that draws on the known, dissolving existing dichotomies and categories. As such, it invites modern readers to rethink not only the biblical Jerusalem but also urban space and its relationship to nature more generally.  © 2022 the author(s), published by De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston."

Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11 explains Sustainable Cities and Communities’ concern for society. Rapid urbanisation and accommodating the masses, which started shifting from rural to urban society, brought the construction of cities in full swing. This study reviewed the publication and citation trends, sources, trending topics, thematic evolution and thematic map (niche, motor, basic and emerging or declining themes) through metadata extracted from the Scopus database using the Biblioshiny (R-tool) version 4.2.3 open-access software tool. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, only 537 metadata appeared sufficient for the final analysis. This research answered various research questions, an eye-opening lesson in the present scenario, where every country is marching towards achieving the SDG 2030 agenda. Major publications appeared after the launch of the SDG 2030 agenda, i.e., in 2015. Citations also increased after 2016 and reached their peak in 2021 with 1808 citations. Sustainable development goals and sustainability appeared as the most trending topics, whereas, recently, some topics have also emerged which can play a significant role in achieving the SDG 2030 agenda. Various themes such as sustainable development goals, remote sensing, machine learning and Ethiopia have emerged recently that need to be focused on by future researchers to understand this growing concern better, along with the policy development and strict practice approach. More focus is required on the emerging themes, which can be helpful to progress towards SDG 11. More research, and mega-cities with a sustainability approach, can be a milestone in attaining the SDG 11 target. © 2023 by the authors."

Design/methodology/approach: In the study, using 117 policy documents focusing on the development of low-carbon eco-cities issued by the Chinese central government as well as the relevant ministries and commissions between 2010 and 2019 and comprehensively adopting bibliometric and content analysis methods, the contents of policy documents are quantitatively analyzed from three dimensions: policy instrument, policy area and policy target. Findings: The study finds the following. Ecological environment and low-carbon development are the focus of policy attention. Policy-promulgating institutions have formed a core subnetwork, that is, an “iron triangle.” There exists a structural imbalance in the use of policy instruments, and the distribution of policy instruments in different policy areas exhibits significant differentiating characteristics. Driven by different policy targets, the proportion of the policy instrument types adopted by the government is constantly changing. According to these findings, suggestions are put forward to optimize China's low-carbon eco-city development policy. Originality/value: (1) A three-dimensional policy analysis framework is conducted from the perspective of policy instrument, which is innovative in theory. (2) This paper finds the selective utilization rationality and evolution rule of China's low-carbon eco-city development policy instruments. (3) Recommendations on optimizing China's low-carbon eco-city development policies are discussed systematically, which plays a theoretical guiding role in optimizing the development policies of low-carbon eco-cities in China. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."

This research introduces the genetic algorithm for logistics routing to address pertinent research issues, such as suboptimal scheduling of time-sensitive orders and reverse distribution of goods. It proposes an enhanced scheme integrating the Metropolis criterion. To address the limited local search ability of the genetic algorithm, this study combines the simulated annealing algorithm's powerful local optimization capability with the genetic algorithm, thereby developing a genetic algorithm with the Metropolis criterion. The proposed method preserves the optimal chromosome in each generation population and accepts inferior chromosomes with a certain probability, thereby enhancing the likelihood of finding an optimal local solution and achieving global optimization. A comparative study is conducted with the Ant Colony Optimization, Artificial Bee Colony, and Particle Swarm Optimization algorithms, and empirical findings demonstrate that the proposed genetic algorithm effectively achieves excellent results over these algorithms. © 2023 Ran et al."

In evaluations of urban competitiveness, financial factors are frequently emphasized. In this systematic study for the future sustainable urban landscape (SUL), we use the instance of Penang Island, Malaysia, to present an integrated methodology for finding, evaluating, and validating good indicators for developing an urban landscape index that balances economic, sociocultural, and environmental factors. First, we provide a framework for developing such an index by developing a Delphi Analytical Hierarchy Process (DAHP) model that aids in choosing the most important aspects and sub criteria affecting the sustainability of urban landscapes. Then, under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), we demonstrate how to use these data to assess the competitiveness of various zones on Penang Island, namely Bayan Lepas and George Town. According to the quantitative results of the DAHP model, economic criteria, which were given a weight of 0.595 and a corresponding inconsistency (CI) of 0.04, had a greater influence on Penang Island’s urban landscape than environmental criteria, which were given a weight of 0.276 and a CI of 0.02, and social and cultural criteria, which were given a weight of 0.128 and a CI of 0.08. In terms of economic criteria, Zone 1 has a weight of 0.360, which indicates that it has less sway than Zone 2, which has a weight of 0.636.

"Remarks on the Concept of a Sustainable City in Light of Konrad Lorenz’s Concept of Man","2023","10.3390/su15032443","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85147995366&doi=10.3390%2fsu15032443&partnerID=40&md5=5cb927df4ea9f7ff11af2f567e38f2ac","For several decades now, intensive research has been carried out on the concept of a city that would be as environmentally friendly as possible, while simultaneously providing a high quality of life for its residents. As a result of this research, the concept of a sustainable city that addresses these challenges has been developed. The significance of this issue is evidenced by the fact that Sustainable Development Goal 11 is explicitly concerned with this topic. This paper aims to analyze the concept of a sustainable city from the perspective of the so-called ‘layered’ concept of man authored by Konrad Lorenz. It is based on the observation that the pace of biological evolution and that of the cultural evolution man undergoes differ significantly. While humans have adapted very quickly to urban living in their cultural layer, adaptation to city life in their biological layer has been very slow. The natural way of life pursued by the Homo sapiens was a hunter–gatherer lifestyle, which biological evolution had adapted the species to over hundreds of thousands of years. The changes associated with the Neolithic Revolution and the formation of the first cities took place about 11,000 years ago. Thus, not enough time has elapsed for humans to adapt biologically to their radically changed living conditions. The purpose of this paper is to look from a new perspective at the challenges faced by city dwellers, and in doing so, to identify the sources of these challenges and to arrange them in a hierarchy. An additional goal is to expand the argument for promoting certain elements of a sustainable city. Indeed, much seems to suggest that Lorenz’s concept offers a novel approach to looking at such urban issues as the challenges of overpopulation, man’s restricted access to nature, and the ever-increasing pace of life. © 2023 by the author."

The unjustifiable use of these non-renewable resources can affect the stability between environmental and biological diversity which leads to greenhouse effect. This situation requires awareness and motivation to encourage people towards sustainable energy use and conservation in order to reduce global warming. For effective implementation, government initiatives require a systematic public participation to assess household's level of energy self-sustainability and reward accordingly. On this regard, we introduce an IoT powered green architecture to assign an optimal green score to a household by assessing the households’ level of energy self-sustainability using a novel green score algorithm based green score meter. The green score algorithm will results high green score rating to a household with high renewable energy production than the non-renewable energy consumption with less air contamination. Based the household energy data, the green score meter computes the green score rating of a household using the green score algorithm and forward the score to the authorized third party like cloud server for green rank calculation and virtual display. Here, we present a tax exemption scheme which benefits the households with high green score rating. The existing frameworks (HEMS, iCHEMS, SHEMS) monitor and aware the user/household for efficient energy management, cost management but in contrast our proposed green architecture is an integrated platform for collective energy management to evaluate energy self-sustainability of the household, so as to give financial incentives. Thus, our proposed green score based tax exemption scheme will appreciate and urge the residents to burn-through less natural assets and forestall less contamination. © 2023 Elsevier Inc."

However, quantifying climate uncertainties is challenging due to the stochastic and unpredictable nature of future climate events. This paper develops a novel and general framework to quantify climate uncertainties for urban energy system design using scenario-based stochastic optimization. Climate models are coupled with building performance simulation to generate scenarios for uncertainty quantification and energy system optimization. We apply this optimization framework to US cities for demonstration. We find that climate uncertainties in renewable generation and energy demand can lead to significant performance differences in urban energy systems. Neglecting climate uncertainties results in an optimistic energy system; however, it is unable to provide stable power supply to urban cities. Moreover, we observe that maintaining a certain degree of grid integration is beneficial for urban energy systems and can alleviate the economic burden of urban cities. Finally, we provide some valuable insights on urban energy systems for system designer and policymakers. The designers should fully consider uncertainties associated with various climate events during system design and deploy proper backup systems in case of contingency. The policymakers should thoroughly account for climate uncertainties and their resulting costs when stipulating energy policies for promoting low-carbon energy systems. Both designers and policymakers need to cooperate together and coordinate their actions on urban energy systems towards sustainable cities. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"

As such, the aim of this article is to analyze how sustainable/green city/place branding is understood and what its main idiosyncrasies are. For that an exploratory literature review was implemented and 32 articles were analyzed. It is possible to conclude that there are three main strands covering the topic related to green, sustainable, and slow city (cittaslow) or place branding. Moreover, green resources are dealt with seeking to improve the image of the city, the quality of urban life, and the green spaces supporting the city as a tourism destination. Complementarily, sustainability embraces also economic and social aspects, which are not fully covered in the previous strand. Finally, the cittaslow perspective follows a sustainable perspective more closely than the green/environmental one. The three strands are very segmented and the stage of development is still in a growing up stage. The stakeholders play an important role in disclosing the natural resources, the environmental challenges for a city/place to develop a positive sustainable reputation. Finally, there is an important role from the public policy perspective to position the city as a green, sustainable place destination. © This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Atribution 4.0 Internacional License"

This study analyzed the logistics development of 11 cities in the Guanzhong Plain urban agglomeration (GPUA) of China. Compared to traditional urban logistics evaluation methods considering individual attributes, this study constructed a multi-layer complex logistics network of urban agglomerations (MCLNUA) based on complex network theory, which takes into account the multiple connections between cities. The development levels of logistics in these cities were evaluated from a multi-dimensional perspective of “point–line–surface”, (the “point” represents the node characteristic index of the city, the “line” represents the strength and direction of urban logistics connections between cities, and the “surface” represents the cohesive subgroup of cities). An urban spatial hierarchy and corresponding spatial development plan for urban logistics were also developed. The results show that there are significant differences in logistics levels between different cities. The spatial structure of the overall network connections shows the pattern of being strong in the south and weak in the north, and strong in the east and weak in the west. There are differences in the strength of connections between cohesive subgroups.

The purpose of this study was to explore the possibility of extending the NbS of a single variable to two variables for the better development of sustainable cities. Both forestation and wetland restoration are regarded as NbS for sustainable city development. The research approach of “forest–wetland” NbS was proposed and centers on the process and core issues of traditional NbS. Taking Tianjin as an example, the spatial patterns of forests and wetlands, correlation between the spatial distribution of forests and wetlands, and spatial correlation between the areas of forest growth and wetland growth within a certain distance in different years were studied using a spatial distribution pattern analysis, geographic concentration analysis, kernel density estimation and spatial autocorrelation analysis. Based on the core issues of NbS and the above spatial analysis, a “forest–wetland” spatial planning strategy was formulated. The main conclusions are as follows: forest and wetland were negatively correlated in the whole area of Tianjin, forest resources w mainly located in north, while wetland resources were mainly located in south. Compared with forests, the spatial distribution of wetlands in Tianjin was more balanced. There exist synergy and trade-offs between forest and wetland area under certain circumstances. Growth of forests was positively correlated with the growth of wetlands, within a distance of 0–400 m from 2000 to 2010, and within a distance of 0–600 m from 2010 to 2020. An increase in forest area will lead to an increase in evaporation, which in turn will hinder the growth of wetlands in Tianjin. Forest–wetland ecological network could promote synergistic between forest and wetland, and grey infrastructure to reduce potential trade-off between forest and wetland. © 2022 by the authors."

In Hanoi, the capital city of Vietnam, the “green city” is core to the state’s urbanisation agenda, with a green corridor envisioned as part of the city’s Master Plan for 2030. We investigate the patterns and processes of small-scale urban agriculture underway in this green corridor to better understand whether this type of agriculture actually intersects with, and is supported by, state plans. We frame our paper in conceptual debates around food safety and everyday governance, while supporting our analysis with data from interviews with resident gardeners and officials, as well as the mapping of urban gardens in seven wards in and alongside the green corridor. We pay attention to practices and motivations of residents who maintain small-scale vegetable and fruit plots (the most prevalent form of urban agriculture), and the challenges and constraints they face. Our work reveals the temporary and interim status of urban agriculture in Hanoi, highlighting the contradictions within Vietnam’s “green city” discourse. Nonetheless, urban residents still undertake urban agriculture, negotiating or compromising with state officials, to meet their demands for fresh and safe food. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
"Quantifying urban heat island using multiple data sources for planning a sustainable city in an arid climatic zone","2023","10.1007/s10668-023-04162-4","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85177463101&doi=10.1007%2fs10668-023-04162-4&partnerID=40&md5=0da04964bcc4d8e93b861daa10a4e19a","The effects of urbanization on cities have been well documented around the world. The term ""urban heat island"" (UHI) refers to one of several consequences of urbanization. The intensity of UHI is quantified in Muscat and its neighbouring sub-cities during 2019–2020. These sub-cities have seen a rapid increase in inhabitants over the last decade ranging between 15.1 and 107.4%. Land surface and air temperature were measured to quantify UHI under different land use types. The study found that all the selected sub-cities have shown variations in UHI influenced by land surface temperature, which ranged from 0.24 to 6.74 °C. In general, the measured land surface temperature indicated maximum UHI values in both winters (UHI = 6.74 °C) and summer (UHI = 5.07 °C) seasons. While measured air temperature shows the formation of UHI in the winter season in all sub-cities with a maximum value of 4.65 °C. In contrast, in summer it occurs only in two sub-cities with values of 0.65 °C and 4.17 °C at the night. Analyzing meteorological and remotely sensed data emphasizes findings from field measurements with the formation of UHI in all sub-cities in winter with values ranging between 0.43 and 5.37 °C, meanwhile, its absence in most sub-cities during the summer. There are significant differences (P < 0.05) among the land use types with the lowest mean value in greenery space (21.70 ± 0.59 °C). The mean land surface temperature with respect to land cover type follow the pattern of road > pavement > bare soil > vegetation except for the daytime in summer, clearly demonstrates the influence of vegetation in reducing UHI effect. This was also verified by the evidence that the air temperature above the vegetation cover were reduced by 1.3 to 2.1 °C and 2.6 to 3.1 °C during day and nighttime respectively. Additionally, there was a moderate correlation between land surface and air temperature in the winter (R2 = 0.58) compared to the summer (R2 = 0.29). Quantification of UHI is important for city planners to ensure sustainable urbanization and take into account land use and land cover changes in the future to build resilient cities. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."

However, the scale and rate of urbanization fundamentally disrupt the challenges that eco-cities must contend with. This is coupled with the increased need to understand, plan, and manage eco-cities in new and innovative ways. On this account, transformative processes and practices within eco-cities are being highly responsive to a form of data-driven urbanism as a more effective way to address and overcome the kinds of challenges that eco-cities are designed to solve. That is, eco-cities are increasingly embracing and leveraging what smart cities have to offer in terms of data-driven technologies and applied solutions in an effort to monitor, evaluate, and improve their performance with respect to sustainability—under what has been termed “data-driven smart eco-cities.” The aim of this paper is to develop an integrated model for strategic sustainable urban development based on empirical research in the form of case studies. This model combines and integrates the leading global paradigms of urbanism—namely eco-cities, data–driven smart cities, and environmentally data-driven smart sustainable cities—in terms of their strategies and solutions. The main contribution of this study lies in providing an innovative way of building future models for sustainable urban development, as well as practical insights into developing strategic planning processes of transformative change toward sustainability based on integrated approaches. The proposed model serves to facilitate progress toward achieving the long-term goals of sustainability for those cities that are badging or regenerating themselves as eco-cities, or manifestly planning to be or become smart eco-cities in the era of big data. © 2021 The Author(s).

Milan’s run-flow irrigation system, and particularly its flagship water meadows, have been under great admiration by scholars from all over the world since the eighteenth century. Today the traditional irrigation system is in crisis and the water meadows are in sharp decline. Protection is entrusted by the regional parks around Milan, which implement passive to pro-active protection. Some scientific research and empirical evidence show that the combination of these ancient techniques can ensure minimum water quantity in case of drought and water absorption in case of excess rain. Their benefits could potentially expand to large areas, as was the previous meadows extension, and could also be profitable for sustainable peri-urban areas. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

By 2030, Chinese cities must have 80% of their land drained by Blue-Green Infrastructure (BGI) to build critically needed flood resilience. Costs must be met from municipal and private finance, but BGI lacks the revenue streams of public assets like utilities, so has limited appeal to public-private partnerships. Finance options, including Green Bonds targeting institutional investors, and Payment for Urban Ecosystem Service schemes targeting local citizens and businesses, need developing. Green city branding could lever such finance but despite widespread use of green branding to attract investment, sponge branding strategies are immature, and alignment is needed in green branding between sponge project type (e.g., flagship and retrofit), financial instrument, and target financier, to develop differentiated brands that appeal to a diversity of SCP investors. With little grassroots input into city branding, and SCP problems of green gentrification, local support for SCP implementation may be at risk. This is concerning, because cities need local citizens and businesses to invest in the SCP to achieve the extensive retrofit needed, as retrofit (using small-scale BGI such as stormwater planters, de-paving, and raingardens) has little appeal for institutional investors. © 2022 The authors."

This paper aims to identify the walkability drivers in urban areas and investigate walkability behavior. The survey was carried out in southern Brazil, with a sample of 439 respondents. Data were subject to factorial analysis, regression analysis, and variance analysis. The analysis revealed four walkability drivers that explain pedestrian behavior: (i) infrastructure, (ii) traffic conditions and behavior, (iii) built and natural environments, and (iv) social relations. The results show that built and natural environments and social relations were the most significant aspects in explaining walkability’s overall perception. Concerning socio-demographic aspects, the study points out that (i) men feel safer than women when walking in the neighborhood; (ii) the presence of trees and attractive places along the street increases the walking behavior of non-sedentary people; and (iii) the perception of the neighborhood’s beauty increases with age. The research provides contributions regarding understanding the interrelated aspects of walkability behavior. Finally, the study offers relevant evidence for social researchers and urban planners by identifying walkability drivers and supporting political and academic debate elements. © 2022, Kauno Technologijos Universitetas.

In this study we performed a field experiment to evaluate the loss of energy of a standardized acoustic emission (generated with notes and a call of the Clay-colored Thrush – Turdus grayi). For this, we emitted the acoustic signal and recovered it at increasing radial distances from 26 fixed emission points (i.e., 10 m, 20 m, 40 m, 80 m, 120 m, 160 m) located across the city of Xalapa (Mexico). Our results show that the emitted signal was not recorded beyond 80 m from the emission point. The number and height of the assessed physical obstacles between the emitted signal and the receiving equipment showed to drive our main result, with built elements representing a major barrier than vegetation ones in terms of the recovered energy of the emitted signal. Interestingly, we found that, for both types of physical obstacles, a height of ~7 m was a common threshold influencing the recovered energy of the emitted signal. © 2021, The Author(s)."

Explaining these energy transitions re-quires combining insights from the disciplines investigating these factors. The existing literature is not consistent in identifying these factors, nor in proposing how they can be combined. In this paper, three contributions are made by combining the key demographic factors of households to estimate household energy consumption. Firstly, a mathematical formula is developed by considering the demographic determinants that influence energy consumption, such as the number of persons per household, median age, occupancy rate, households with children, and number of bedrooms per household. Secondly, a geographical position algorithm is proposed to identify the geographical locations of households. Thirdly, the derived formula is validated by collecting demographic factors of five statistical regions from local government databases, and then compared with the electricity consumption benchmarks provided by the energy regulators. The practical feasibility of the method is demonstrated by comparing the estimated energy consumption values with the electricity consumption benchmarks provided by energy regulators. The comparison results indicate that the error between the benchmark and estimated values for the five different regions is less than 8% (7.37%), proving the efficacy of this method in energy consumption estimation processes. © 2022 by the authors.

But since 1895, anaerobic digestion has been used to recover gas as a waste management system in England. Anaerobic digesters are one of the most well-known systems that are used worldwide to get rid of waste and generate energy, yet they have never been employed in Egypt. This research aims to determine the economic, social, and environmental impacts of anaerobic digesters in Egyptian cities and districts. From an economic perspective, the study estimates the energy produced from storing organic wastes in anaerobic digesters, using a quantitative approach to measure the efficiency of anaerobic digesters in Egyptian districts. In this study, the data were collected using surveys among residents and cleaners in the study area. The information gathered in this study was used to estimate the amount of organic waste (OW) produced by area 4 El-korba in Heliopolis, which will be stored in an anaerobic digester (AD) and used to generate heat, electricity, and fertilizer. In terms of social impact, the study relied on a site questionnaire to measure the impact of waste accumulation on the Egyptians. The aim of this paper is to study the storage of the OW collected from El Korba district in AD and how it can save electricity consumed by the district residential sector.

Currently there is another significant development for cities—the need and external pressure to be “smart”, often understood merely as applying the latest digital technologies to become more efficient. The Smart City and the Sustainable City can work hand in hand or hinder each other, depending on their interpretation. In this study we focus on five Smart Cities in Western Germany to get a closer look at how they shape their processes and whether the underlying motivation is to become a technologically Smart City, focus on sustainable development, or both. With the help of the innovation biography research method, we show how cities shape the dynamic process towards forming a Smart City, the role sustainable urban development plays in the process, who the actors involved are, and the important role improved knowledge management then plays for the diffusion of the Smart Sustainable City within the region. It becomes clear how important communication and narratives are both in the process within each City towards forming a Smart Sustainable City and for the first step of diffusion, the adaptation of other cities within the region.

As such, they are full of contestations, conflicts, and contingencies that are not easily captured, steered, and predicted respectively. In short, they are characterized by wicked problems. Therefore, they are increasingly embracing and leveraging what smart cities have to offer as to big data technologies and their novel applications in a bid to effectively tackle the complexities they inherently embody and to monitor, evaluate, and improve their performance with respect to sustainability—under what has been termed “data-driven smart sustainable cities.” This paper analyzes and discusses the enabling role and innovative potential of urban computing and intelligence in the strategic, short-term, and joined-up planning of data-driven smart sustainable cities of the future. Further, it devises an innovative framework for urban intelligence and planning functions as an advanced form of decision support. This study expands on prior work done to develop a novel model for data-driven smart sustainable cities of the future. I argue that the fast-flowing torrent of urban data, coupled with its analytical power, is of crucial importance to the effective planning and efficient design of this integrated model of urbanism. This is enabled by the kind of data-driven and model-driven decision support systems associated with urban computing and intelligence. The novelty of the proposed framework lies in its essential technological and scientific components and the way in which these are coordinated and integrated given their clear synergies to enable urban intelligence and planning functions. These utilize, integrate, and harness complexity science, urban complexity theories, sustainability science, urban sustainability theories, urban science, data science, and data-intensive science in order to fashion powerful new forms of simulation models and optimization methods. These in turn generate optimal designs and solutions that improve sustainability, efficiency, resilience, equity, and life quality.

While many scholars point to the persistence of racial inequality, we observe the urban greening orthodoxy in urban planning and development as evidencing a deeper strain of environmental injustice bound up in the legacy and continuance of White supremacy. In this article, following the prompts of the Black Lives Matter Movement to enact life-affirming Black geographies, we call for decolonizing the green city and for an emancipatory spatial imaginary to enact green justice. Reflecting on the development of the 11th Street Bridge Park in the predominantly Black Anacostia neighborhood in Southeast, Washington, DC, we ask how urban greening can enact a more emancipatory green justice. We use this case example to trace the contours and constraints of current greening and equity logics and practices and contend that decolonization and emancipation fundamentally require new spatial planning practices. While the green project is deployed as an ""intentional""equity-centered infrastructure, it is limited in its ability to embrace multiple forms of land recognition, redistribution, control, and reparations and to develop green practices that engage with the history of a multilayered geography of dispossession and include cultural and symbolic recognitions of networks of resilience and care. We thus argue for a more emancipatory spatial imaginary in urban planning that more directly confronts White supremacist forms of dispossession, centers resistance to anti-Blackness, and articulates a geography of reparations through decolonizing settlement patterns at multiple geographical scales.  © Copyright 2022, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc."

Increasingly, researchers are highlighting the need to apply sustainable urban growth principles to the field of urban development, arguing that this would reduce the negative impacts of urbanization processes (poverty, air pollution, unemployment, and crime). At the same time, cities are competing with one another to maintain their position in the urban hierarchy, not only in the short term, but also in the long term. The COVID-19 pandemic affected many areas of our everyday life: over 5.85 million deaths, increased unemployment, the introduction of restrictions, the closure of national borders, and various other circumstances have all undoubtedly affected to a certain degree those factors which serve to influence competitiveness. The aim of this article is to conduct an integrated competitiveness assessment of the Baltic capitals within the context of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic for the period 2015–2020, according to an integrated assessment model for urban competitiveness (MDK), which is based upon the principles of sustainable development. A systematic and comparative analysis of the concepts published in the scientific literature has been performed, the concepts of sustainable city and sustainable urban competitiveness have been formed, research and methods of urban competitiveness evaluation have been carried out, and a comprehensive competitiveness assessment of the results of the study showed that the evaluation of integrated competitiveness of a sustainable city in the context of the impact of COVID-19 (using the Baltic capitals as an example in the period 2015–2020), in terms of the multi-criteria SAW and TOPSIS evaluation methods, is in the highest position in 2016–2019. Vilnius is in second place during the whole period 2016–2019. Riga takes third place in 2015–2019 (except in 2020, when it exchanges places with Vilnius and takes second place).

The article presents an innovative technology for the remote monitoring of chemical raw materials, including fertilizers, during their storage and transport from the place of manufacture to the local distributor or recipient. Methods: The method assumes the monitoring and identification of special transport bags, so-called “big-bags,” through embedded RFID tags or LEB labels and monitoring the key parameters of their content, i.e., temperature, humidity, insolation, and pressure, using a measuring micro-station that is placed in the transported raw material. Results: The automation of inference based on the collected information about the phenomenon in question (the distribution of parameters: pressure, temperature, and humidity), and expert knowledge, allows the creation of an advisory system prototype indicating how to manage the measuring devices. Conclusions: No similar solution in the field of monitoring environmental parameters has been implemented in the Polish market. The developed system enables the monitoring of 10,000 pieces of big bags in at least 30 locations simultaneously. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."
"UNDERSTANDING THE EXPERIENCE OF MULTI-SECTORAL PARTNERSHIPS IN RIVER MANAGEMENT FOR A HEALTHY AND SUSTAINABLE CITY IN BANJARMASIN, INDONESIA","2022","10.37268/mjphm/vol.22/no.2/art.1660","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138582977&doi=10.37268%2fmjphm%2fvol.22%2fno.2%2fart.1660&partnerID=40&md5=614de310f9c6deca471352cc8433e112","A sustainable city is one of the programs required to achieve the 2030 SDGs. Although Banjarmasin contains a thousand rivers along which a large population resides for livelihood support, they are still polluted by some people that fail to perform proper subsequent maintenance. The problem of river waste will have an impact on public health. A study on river waste management in Banjarmasin City is essential, specifically in multi-sectoral partnerships. It plays an integral role in organizing a Healthy City. Therefore, this study aimed to understand the experience of multi-sectoral partnerships in river management in Banjarmasin to create a healthy and sustainable city. A phenomenological descriptive method was carried out through in-depth interviews with 16 participants, followed by a survey, and documentation. Data collection through in-depth interviews was conducted from August 2020 to June 2021 following certain guidelines. To ensure the rigor of data (trustworthiness), triangulation and comparison to existing documents were performed. Furthermore, partnership activities were observed, then the data were analyzed by identifying all the statements relevant to the phenomenon or horizontalization. In this study, it was showed that the reasons to join the partnership include: first, community awareness and responsibility due to job description. Second, the factors associated with partnership effectiveness, namely commitment, communication, and control among various sectors. Empowerment of local communities and effectiveness of partnership are needed for river maintenance. It was concluded that multi-sectoral partnerships are important in addressing river management for sustainable healthy cities. © 2022, Malaysian Journal of Public Health Medicine.

"Antecedents of behavioral intentions for green city tourists","2022","10.1007/s10668-021-01440-x","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105490751&doi=10.1007%2fs10668-021-01440-x&partnerID=40&md5=68f5e1ab12c8d7c2d6ab244cae10dcd3","Many cities have been evaluated as green cities in recent years and have gained the chance to promote their local tourism development by appealing to tourists with environmental concerns. Nonetheless, few studies have explored green city tourists and particularly explored the drivers of their behavioral intentions. Accordingly, this study aims to investigate the antecedents of behavioral intentions among green city tourists by proposing a model that integrates behavioral intentions, experience quality, and three green-related constructs—green city image, green perceived value, and green city satisfaction—based on previous studies. The study recruited tourists who have experience with visiting green cities in Taiwan as the sample. A total of 482 responses were gathered via a survey and analyzed via structural equation modeling (SEM). The findings reveal that behavioral intentions are positively affected by green city satisfaction and green perceived value, which function as mediators among green city image, experience quality, and behavioral intentions. The results provide significant implications for practitioners and researchers of green city tourism. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."

However, the continent lacks technological advancement. Therefore, there is a need to apply global data and open geospatial tools for analysis to prevent, stop and comprehend the trend and effects of land degradation, food insecurity and the unsustainability of cities. The study takes three representative indicators (climate risk, land degradation and land consumption) from FAO’s four strategic better’s to demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of global datasets to support decision makers. Three representative cities in Africa are selected for the study—Houet, Burkina Faso (West Africa); Kisumu, Kenya (East Africa); and Analamanga, Madagascar (South East Africa). The study found that eight Fokontany of the Analamanga region were at high risk from climate change; at the ward level, a maximum of 54.2% of the total degraded land area in Kisumu; and maximum land-consumption rate of 1.5 was found in Houet at the department level. The results of this study can be a basis for policymakers in planning an inclusive climate-adaptation measure and sustainable land-use frameworks and policies. © 2022 by the authors.

In addition, urbanization is spreading at an alarming rate across the globe, affecting the environment and society in profound ways. This study reviews previous studies that examined future scenarios of urban areas under the challenges of rapid population growth, urban sprawl and water scarcity in order to improve supported decision-making (SDM). Scholars expected that the rapid development of the urbanization scenario would cause resource sustainability to continually be threatened as a result of excessive use of natural resources. In contrast, a sustainable development scenario is an ambitious plan that relies on optimal land use, which views land as a limited and non-renewable resource. In consequence, estimating these threats together could be crucial for planning sustainable strategies for the long term. In light of this review, the SDM tool could be improved by combining the cellular automata model, water evolution and planning model coupled with geographic information systems, remote sensing and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. Urban planners could use the proposed tool to optimize, simulate and visualize the dynamic processes of land-use change and urban water to overcome critical conditions. © 2022"

The circular economy is one of the most interesting facets of the latter. Nevertheless, no substantial effort has been made so far to establish the link between the circular economy and smart cities. Purpose of the paper: Through the conceptual systemic perspective and quantitative means, the study investigates how the concepts of the smart sustainable city and the circular economy are interconnected. Methodology: After assessing the related scholarly literature to highlight the systemic nature of the connection between a smart sustainable city and a circular economy, we analyze the relationship between the two by operationally quantifying both concepts on the macro level and the level of the single components of smartness and circularity. Operationalizations are based on the relative frequencies with which certain EU cities are mentioned in scholarly documents related to smartness and the circular economy and indexed on Google Scholar. Regression analysis and principal component analysis are used as the main analytical tools. Findings: We find a significant positive relationship between a city’s smartness and circularity. While the presence of specific smart city-related technologies like AI, Big Data, and IoT are less important for the proliferation of circular economy initiatives in a city, the same is not true for the overall presence of an advanced ICT infrastructure. Alternatively, waste management is the element of the circular economy that contributes the most to sustainable urban smartness. Research limits: The analysis is performed on a dataset consisting of 193 EU cities. Therefore, the results cannot be applied to cities outside the EU. Moreover, the indices that operationalize sustainable smartness and circularity are empirically valid but require more in-depth statistical validation. Practical implications: The study suggests city managers and administrators to treat the smart sustainable city concept holistically. Indeed, circular economy initiatives could significantly affect the implementation of smart sustainable urban initiatives. Originality of the paper: Although the literature treats the two concepts extensively, no attempts to quantify the relationship between smart sustainable cities and circular economy have been made until now. We hope this study will shed additional light on the complex systemic nature of the investigated domains. © 2022 Research Results in Biomedicine. All rights reserved."

This study is part of the results of MyGEO, a project funded by the European Commission, and it is based on a collaborative mapping of streets named after women in a medium-sized city (Zaragoza, Spain), in connection with the international initiative GeoChicas (GeoGirls) on OpenStreetMap. Its main objective is to obtain evidence to emphasize, through public and digital space, gender equality and the empowerment of women in teacher education by means of their achievements. The learning methodology consists of (i) standardization and correction of alphanumeric information referring to street names contained in the OpenStreetMap spatial database that identify gender and (ii) linking and creating thematic information through Wikipedia editing. The results show that Zaragoza is at the top of the ranking of Spanish and Latin American cities mapped to date in the “Women’s Streets” viewer, with 18% of the streets named after women, compared to the average 15% in the rest of the 30 cities involved in GeoChicas.

Future networks are anticipated to revolutionize typical applications such as the enhanced mobile broadband services (EMBB), ultra-reliable low latency communication (uRLLC), and massive machine-type communications (mMTC) anywhere and everywhere. This rationalizes the need to investigate the sustainable elements of 5G networks in smart cities to understand how 5G networks can be more environmentally- friendly and energy-efficient. This paper aims to investigate how 5G networks can act as key enablers in achieving sustainability in smart cities, using a macroscopic review. An overview of 5G communication networks and several 5G technologies used in smart city applications to enhance sustainability is presented. This is followed by investigating the indicators that measure sustainability in 5G networks across the environmental, social, and economic dimensions; and sub-dimensions such as energy efficiency, power consumption, carbon footprint, pollution, cost, health, safety, and security. The results show that the majority of research papers focus on the environmental dimensions of sustainability (42%) when attempting to address sustainability in 5G systems and smart cities. The findings also showed a huge interest in the economic (37%) and social (21%) dimensions as well. Further, when examining the sub-dimensions, it was found that most of the studies focused on energy efficiency (20%), power consumption (17%), and cost (15%). © 2013 IEEE."

However, the contestation does not take account of the entire dimensions of sustainable cities. To present a holistic argument, the present study examines the roles of informalities in advancing the sustainable city agenda in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) by using the sustainable development prism as the analytical framework. A Boolean search methodology was adopted to obtain relevant literature written in the English language from repositories such as Scopus, JSTOR, and ProQuest. The results of a synthesis of the literature suggest that informalities play double-pronged roles in the pursuit of the sustainable city development agenda in SSA. Overall, the emergence of informality is as a result of the failure of the formal systems. They provide employment, secure household income and savings, support national income, provide household basic needs (water access and waste management), and enhance civic engagement. However, informalities contribute to social and gender inequality, insecurity, congestion, and pollution. Based on their positive roles in the advancement of sustainable cities, we recommend a rejection of the prohibitive policies and attitudes towards informalities and call for regularisation as an approach to address the associated ills. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"

The sustainable cities are designed based on the concept of IoT. IoT devices consume enormous energy continuously, which needs to be managed efficiently. The efficiency of energy is based on the optimization of the energy infrastructures. In addition, heterogeneous devices in sustainable cities produce enormous data. This huge data needs to be processed and analyzed along with smart energy management to achieve smart decisions. The planning is starting to be realistic through the quantity of data provided in sustainable cities. In this porch, the objective is to illustrate the data generated in sustainable cities in real time. To deal with the aforementioned requirements, this work demonstrates a novel architecture that spotlights the ecology of sustainable cities comprised of sensors, cameras, and other objects along with energy management (eg, Internet of Energy). The proposed system is a layered architecture composed of data collection and energy management, data computation, and decision-making layers. Energy-efficient clustering algorithm and optimized sleeping scheduling methods are utilized in the first layer to collect data from IoT devices with regard to energy management. The second layer is responsible for computation of data resourcefully along with energy efficiency. The third layer is used to provide valuable insights and make intelligent decisions. The architecture is verified with reliable datasets related to smart parking using IoT devices to test and reveal the effectiveness.

People living in cities have higher and higher requirements for landscape, but traditional landscape design cannot achieve efficient and accurate planning. Therefore, the old design method, which cannot meet the complex and changeable urban needs and cannot keep up with the development and changes of the times, is doomed to be eliminated and replaced. This study introduces a GIS system and uses an AHP method to assist landscape design. Through rational resource utilization of topography, vegetation growth, population density, and other conditions, the city can be green and environmentally friendly, reduce energy consumption, and meet people's concept of healthy life. The experimental results show that: (1) through the GIS system, a multidecision model is constructed to choose a reasonable location for the garden. Based on the opinions and scores of all parties, the B place with a score as high as 8.97 was selected. (2) Using comprehensive landscape sensitivity to divide four levels of landscape land-use value and looking for the best landscape vision, it is divided into five scenic functional areas and 12 scenic spots. SPEI and NDVI were used to select cultivated plants and landscapes. (3) Route multifactor comprehensive model is designed to plan garden route. The coincidence degree between the model and the actual road condition is about 87.62%. Citizen satisfaction is between 7 and 9 points, and the comprehensive evaluation is high. (4) The evaluation system of landscape architecture, in which both B-level index and C-level index are higher than 7 points is constructed, which is in line with the expectations of the public and experts and convenient for feedback correction.

The demand for parking spaces has further increased due to rapid population growth, especially in metropolitan areas. One solution to this problem is to locate new public parking lots within city centers so that car owners can use these facilities instead of on-street parking. In this study, a facility location and allocation scheme was engaged to determine the optimal number of and locations for public parking lots. A multiobjective, multiperiod, decision-dependent, two-stage, stochastic mathematical model was developed to fulfill the decision makers' aims via different objectives. In the model, three objectives were considered: minimizing total facility establishment and operational cost, minimizing average unsatisfied demand, and minimizing CO2 emissions. The proposed framework is the first in parking lot literature to address the multiobjectivity of decision-dependent demand within an uncertain environment. The weighted sum method was used to develop the multiobjective model, and two-stage stochastic programming was applied to manage the uncertainty. Hence, the proposed model satisfies critical gaps, predominantly in relation to the problem of parking lot location, and most importantly in creating sustainable cities. The results provide meaningful outcomes for decision makers in terms of optimizing unsatisfied demand, tackling CO2 emissions, and determining the optimal number and location of public parking lots. Furthermore, the robustness of the model was tested through sensitivity analyses.  © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers."

By means of a cross-disciplinary bricolage approach–with a focus on the commons–we aim to construct a holistic view of urban social sustainability. Beginning with the Anthropocene concept, which recognizes the human impact on the Earth’s natural systems and hence highlights the need to include the natural environment as a determinant of good and fair living conditions for all, we remix arguments and examples relating to social sustainability with environmental and spatial dimensions to develop an urban green commons. Our cross-disciplinary perspective extends beyond contemporary social policy by bringing together natural resource management, public health, and spiritual aspects of the commons. In order to fit the plurality of urban contexts across the planet, further critical deliberations are needed, focusing on social sustainability and collective action for sustainable change in each context. © 2021 The Author(s).

This highlights the need of the green city concept with reconsideration of houses, factories, and traffic in a green viewpoint. The literature review confirms that this reconsideration for green space has a positive effect on the air quality of large cities and to reduce the air pollution. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the annual vegetation changes in the green space of Mashhad, Iran as a very populated city in the middle east to study the air pollution. To investigate the relationship between the air pollution and vegetation, the Landsat 8 satellite images for summer seasons of 2013–2019 were used to extract changes in vegetation by calculating the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and the optimized soil adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI). The main contribution in comparison with the relevant studies is to study the relationship between clean, healthy, and unhealthy days with the green space area for the first time in Mashhad, Iran. The results show that the implementation of green city concept in Mashhad, Iran, has been increased by 64, 81, and 53% by NDVI, EVI, and OSAVI, respectively, during the study period.

Private approaches with government-enabling environments have been proved a successful platform for urban services such as housing provision and telecommunication in developing cities. Still private solid waste management (PSWM) seems different in Nigeria. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate the possible perceived hindrances facing PSWM organisations and proffer feasible policies to enhance sustainable clean and healthy cities. Design/methodology/approach: Seven communities within Benin City sub-urban environs were adopted as the study area to accomplish the research’s objectives via a phenomenology type of qualitative research design. The study analysed the collated data from the knowledgeable participants via a thematic approach. Findings: Lax legislative, absence of institutional framework, inadequate economic motivation, inadequate technical operations, among others, emerged as the encumbrances faced by PSWM firms. Wastes dumped along unethical locations such as streets, roads, uncompleted buildings, culverts and drainage channels, and undeveloped plots emerged as the encumbrance outcomes. Findings show that proffering feasible policy solutions to tackle identified hindrances can promote the achievement of SDGs across semi-urban locations in Nigeria. Research limitations/implications: This research is restricted to urban household waste management by PSWM within Nigeria. Also, the study identified the challenges and proffer policy solutions to enhance improved clean environment within the sub-urban and urban cities. Practical implications: As part of this study’s implications, results from this research intend to guide government policymakers and PSWM firms to encourage collaboration in designing appropriate strategic and educational programmes for the householders (customers) in sub-cities. It will be achieved via feasible policies that are tailored towards achieving sustainable health and environment-friendly sub-urban locations.

The utilisation of thousands of light sources around a city acting as wireless access points and delivering location-based content will shift cities towards being smart sustainable cities. Recently, this technology got huge attention from the research community and different research has been conducted to improve this filed. However, there is a noticeable need to develop real-world systems that utilise Li-Fi technology. Methods. This article aims to contribute to developing a Geo-Li-Fi system that uses LED lights to provide the services for collecting contextual data and delivering location-based services (LBS) in different areas of the city. The system is described along with details of its design, implementation and development. Moreover, the overall set-up of the testbed that used to evaluate the proposed system is presented. In addition, an experiment is conducted using a real-world scenario to test the functionality of the system and report the outputs. Results. The effect of the system is discussed according to different aspects of sustainability which include economic, social and environmental aspects. The system was tested in indoor and outdoor environments, and it can be seen that the sunlight does not affect the ability of LEDs to deliver the content during the daytime. Regarding the transmission range of the LED lamp, it can be seen that it is affected by different factors. It depends mainly on the power of lamp, so it will be increased significantly when the power of LED is increased. Also, an increase in the beam angle will result in wider coverage area which affected by the intensity © 2022. Albraheem et al"

This paper aims to analyze the indicators of the São Paulo City Observatory (ObservaSampa), confronting them with the ISO 3712x series (sustainable, smart, and resilient cities) standards, to assess if the former meet both open data principles and the ISO prescriptions. Bibliometric analysis, comparative analysis, cluster analysis, and principal component analysis (PCA) were the methods used in this research. From the comparative analysis, 18 indicators were identified as conforming and 41 as partially conforming. Thus, 20% of the ObservaSampa indicators adhere to the ISO standards. The PCA applied to the conforming indicators shows component 1 is related to socioeconomic dimensions, while component 2 refers to social policy, with both appraisals confirmed by cluster analysis. Measuring and presenting city data in compliance with indicator standards is relevant because they open the possibility of comparing different cities. However, there is still a lack of consensus on a common set of indicators to be accommodated within the current ISO standards system. © 2022 by the authors."

This study incorporates fifty-three indicators on economic, social, environmental, and institutional dimensions to develop a Sustainable Cities Index (SCI) and assess the sustainability performance of thirty metropolitans in Turkey over 2010-2018. Turkish metropolitans constitute an appealing case study due to the rapid urbanization within the same time span. To answer how new metropolitans have been doing and whether they perform better than formerly declared metropolitans in Turkey, we propose a novel methodology with three stages that hybridizes Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (IT2F-AHP) and Complex Proportional Assessment of Alternatives (COPRAS). The former captures a high degree of uncertainty due to the subjective weight assignment by the experts, while the latter calculates aggregate scores for 30 cities. Finally, we conduct posthoc analyses to examine the significance of the urbanization policies in Turkey on the SCI scores. Thus, the study provides valuable insights into urbanization practices and encourages local administrations to spend more effort balancing the benefits and costs of public policies on sustainability. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"

Planning sustainable cities of the future, educated by the lessons of the past and anticipating the challenges of the future, entails articulating a multi-scalar vision that, by further interplaying with major societal trends and paradigm shifts in science and technology, produce new opportunities towards reaching the goals of sustainability. Enabled by big data science and analytics, the ongoing transformative processes within sustainable cities are motivated by the need to address and overcome the challenges hampering progress towards sustainability. This means that sustainable cities should be understood, analyzed, planned, designed, and managed in new and innovative ways in order to improve and advance their contribution to sustainability. Therefore, sustainable cities are increasingly embracing and leveraging what smart cities have to offer in terms of data-driven technologies and applied solutions so as to optimize, enhance, and maintain their performance and thus achieve the desired outcomes of sustainability—under what has been termed “data-driven smart sustainable cities.” Based on a case study analysis, this paper develops an applied theoretical framework for strategic sustainable urban development planning. This entails identifying and integrating the underlying components of data-driven smart sustainable cities of the future in terms of the dimensions, strategies, and solutions of the leading global paradigms of sustainable urbanism and smart urbanism. The novelty of the proposed framework lies in combining compact urban design strategies, eco-city design strategies and technology solutions; data-driven smart city technologies, competences, and solutions for sustainability; and environmentally data-driven smart sustainable city solutions and strategies. These combined have great potential to improve and advance the contribution of sustainable cities to the goals of sustainability through harnessing its synergistic effects and balancing the integration of its dimensions. The main contribution of this work lies in providing new insights into guiding the development of various types of strategic planning processes of transformative change towards sustainability, as well as to stimulate and inspire future research endeavors in this direction. This study informs policymakers and planners about the opportunity of attaining important advances in sustainability by integrating the established models of sustainable urbanism and the emerging models of smart urbanism thanks to the proven role and untapped potential of data-driven technologies in catalyzing sustainable development and thus boosting sustainability benefits. © 2021, The Author(s)."

Nigeria and a few other Asian nations will account for 35% of the urban increase in the future, and there is a scientific projection that further megacities will emerge. Besides, sustainable cities and societies are those that strive to leave a net-zero carbon footprint through smart urban planning and city management. So, in developing public transport scheme, it is essential to manage and implement sustainability assessment performance. In Nigeria, there is a sustainability literacy gap, due to a lack of measurable sustainability techniques, and this has resulted in social, economic and environmental dissatisfaction towards completed highways and roads in the cities. The roads and highways are considered an essential part of modern daily life and will play a key role in the development of sustainable cities. To bridge the knowledge gap, this study argues to develop a sustainability assessment rating system in evaluating highway and road designs in Nigeria. Thirty-six (36) sustainability indicators relevant in assessing highway design are identified along with the sustainability application framework. The findings contribute to gaining insight into climate change impact, and the benefits it makes in adopting an assessment rating system in highway development to decrease climate change catastrophe. © 2021"

The key challenge will be to provide food for all with fewer farmers in rural areas and limited options for expanding cultivated fields in urban areas, with sustainable soil management being a fundamental criterion for achieving sustainability goals. Understanding how nature works in a fast changing world and fostering nature-based agriculture (such as low-input farming) are crucial for sustaining food systems in the face of worsening urban heat island (UHI) effects and other climatic variables. The best fit for the context is transformative agroecology, which connects ecological networks, sustainable farming approaches, and social movements through change-oriented research and action. Even though agroecology has been practiced for over a century, its potential to address the socioeconomic impact of the food system remained largely unexplored until recently. Agroecological approaches, which involve effective interactions between researchers, policy makers, farmers, and consumers, can improve social cohesion and socioeconomic synergies while reducing the use of various agricultural inputs. This review presents a timeline of agroecology transformation from the past to the present and discusses the possibilities, prospects, and challenges of agroecological urbanism toward a resilient urban future. © 2022 by the authors.

However, in recent times, some scholars argue that informal urbanism has positive implications for the attainment of the sustainable city development goals. Following this view, this study investigates the experimental projects (referred to as Experimental Informal Urbanism – EIU) developed by slum dwellers in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) in response to their deprivations and discusses their implications for the region's sustainable city development agenda. The study relied solely on secondary data (both scholarly and grey literature) that were extracted using search engines and data repositories such as Scopus, Web of Science, Google, Google Scholar, and the Mendeley Literature search function. The results indicate that slum residents in major cities in SSA have engineered innovative solutions to their deprivations. Some of the initiatives are: a) greenspace development on refuse dumpsites, b) solar-powered cars, c) productive reuse of plastic waste, organic waste, and electronic waste (e-waste), d) water sharing and e) plastic and sandbag housing. These innovative initiatives promote resilience and have positive implications for the sustainable city development agenda of SSA cities. However, some of these initiatives could have adverse health and environmental consequences. We therefore call on states and city authorities to consciously take stock of innovative initiatives of slums and research ways to harness, replicate, and integrate them into their sustainable city development agenda. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"

However, today's cities have many trade-off (compatibility) problems related to peacetime-emergency, global-local, and so on, in addition to inertia to change. In this paper, we presented the idea of a new local design in which people's well-being is maintained and improved even in the new normal, based on the idea of “three compatibility problems.” As a concrete measure, we developed the concept of milieu that emphasizes local “place” and “innovation,” and expresses its socio-economic function after including the void spaces of today's cities. At the same time, we proposed an autonomous and self-sustaining segmented city that can respond to outbreaks by increasing the self-efficacy of citizens. Furthermore, based on an analysis of the implementation cases of integrated transportation machizukuri with railway development in Japan, we reported that the emergence of new local design has already been seen in industry-government-private partnership efforts. © 2021 International Association of Traffic and Safety Sciences"

From a methodological point of view, Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) methods proved their usability in the sustainability evaluation domain. Nevertheless, the process of building a model in the classical MCDA paradigm is based on a single set of input data. Therefore, it may lead to oversimplification, especially in the domain of sustainability. Moreover, in addition to the current assessment, it is also important to know the dynamics of sustainability change over time. Therefore, this paper proposes an innovative sustainability assessment method that integrates the MCDA approach with the variability of the alternatives’ performance measurement called Data vARIability Assessment Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (the DARIA-TOPSIS method). This method was used to assess sustainable cities and communities in 26 European countries. Time-based analyses conducted using the DARIA-TOPSIS method for aggregated data (countries), individual sustainability dimensions, and alternatives proved our new approach's usefulness, suitability, and effectiveness in sustainable cities and society domain. © 2022 The Author(s)"

In this study, the concept of carbon missions per unit consumption (CEPC) is introduced, which is used to represent the combined effects of ICE on cities’ economy and carbon emissions. The influencing factors can be divided into three categories: Internet-famous stores, consumers, and cities. A regression model is constructed and used to analyze the influence mechanism of each relevant factor on CEPC by category. Results indicate that CEPC is trivially correlated with Internet-famous store factor and significantly correlated with consumer and city factors. Occupation, total consumption, carbon emissions, and travel mode within the consumer factor have correlation coefficients of 0.083, −0.230, 0.937, and, 0.693, respectively; and annual carbon emissions per capita, carbon emissions per unit of gross domestic product per capita, and urban road area per capita within the city factor have correlation coefficients of −0.042, −0.041, and −0.052, respectively. The city factor has less significant influence on CEPC than the consumer factor. Finally, suggestions for sustainable urban development in the context of ICE are presented from three perspectives: urban design, consumer behavior, and business strategy. © 2021"

Notwithstanding the global attention the smart city concept has received within the last decade, studies establishing pragmatic approaches for implementing smart sustainable city strategies in the Gulf region are rare. This study modelled a practical framework for implementing smart sustainable city strategies and megaprojects in one of the Gulf cities. A qualitative research methodology was used to assess smart city strategies from four cities to identify the optimum implementation strategies. This study design framework adopted a case study methodol-ogy, the identification of knowledge gaps, data collection and analysis, and interpretations of key findings. Best practices, paramount/relevant stakeholders, main issues/relevant considerations, 15 key performance indicators (KPI), and outputs/deliverables involved in diverse smart sustainable city strategies and project lifecycle phases were identified. The lifecycle phases adopted in the study were (i) conceptualization, (ii) planning/design, and (iii) installation/closure. A pragmatic understanding of how to effectively appraise, monitor, and implement smart sustainable city strategies and megaprojects is provided for policy/decision-makers and built environment experts in Saudi Arabia and globally. The proposed implementation strategic framework can perform the function of an appraisal tool for assessing each phase of the smart city project’s life cycle progress, informing preventions of delays or implementation challenges.

Indeed, the processes and practices of both of these approaches to urban planning and development are becoming highly responsive to a form of data-driven urbanism, giving rise to a new phenomenon known as “data-driven smart sustainable urbanism.” Underlying this emerging approach is the idea of combining and integrating the strengths of sustainable cities and smart cities and harnessing the synergies of their strategies and solutions in ways that enable sustainable cities to optimize, enhance, and maintain their performance on the basis of the innovative data-driven technologies offered by smart cities. These strengths and synergies can be clearly demonstrated by combining the advantages of sustainable urbanism and smart urbanism. To enable such combination, major institutional transformations are required in terms of enhanced and new practices and competences. Based on case study research, this paper identifies, distills, and enumerates the key benefits, potentials, and opportunities of sustainable cities and smart cities with respect to the three dimensions of sustainability, as well as the key institutional transformations needed to support the balancing of these dimensions and to enable the introduction of data-driven technology and the adoption of applied data-driven solutions in city operational management and development planning. This paper is an integral part of a futures study that aims to analyze, investigate, and develop a novel model for data-driven smart sustainable cities of the future. I argue that the emerging data-driven technologies for sustainability as innovative niches are reconfiguring the socio-technical landscape of institutions, as well as providing insights to policymakers into pathways for strengthening existing institutionalized practices and competences and developing and establishing new ones.

Assessing the benefit of using a particular cloud service, especially if such a service is being offered by providers that may be new to the cloud marketplace, remains a challenge. Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) provides a certification approach that associates a ranking to providers based on their capability assessment using a “cloud control matrix”. A provider can make a self-assessment, or an assessment can be undertaken by a third party. The intention is to increase user trust in a provider based on their rating using this methodology. This work investigates whether a similar certification methodology can be applied to edge resources, especially if these edge resources are combined with cloud services in a “smart cities” context. Can a CSA-like approach also be used to increase trust in use of edge resources? How would the CSA methodology need to change to support this type of assessment, and how useful is such an approach likely to be in practice? We propose a risk assessment methodology that can be used to address these concerns, and evaluate it in a practical application using both edge and cloud computing resources. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"

This theoretical baseline is followed by a description of some practical approaches already applied for including environmental migrants in sustainable cities. The wide variety and lack of cohesion justifies the need for a framework, leading to three principal characteristics of a governance framework suitable for addressing vulnerability and environmental migration for urban sustainability: horizontally and vertically networked, inclusive, and evidence-based.

Although Japan was one of the early countries to release its general AI principles, it has been relatively slow in establishing conditions where administrative agencies may use AI. Granted, there have been some recent scholarship that discusses the usage of AI in general under Japanese administrative law, but the use of green AI in city planning under Japanese law has not yet been discussed. Hence, this paper intends to focus on green AI in city planning and discuss the conditions for usage based on different categories of AI. Design/methodology/approach: This paper conducts a legal analysis on the utilization of AI for the purpose of sustainable city planning and administration in Japan. The approach of this paper is to summarize the existing scholarship in Japanese administrative law and analyse the new elements in the new field of green AI in city planning. This paper is not a natural science paper. The social science method of jurisprudence is used. This paper cites only public sources, and no informal literature has been referenced. Findings: This paper establishes the conditions where Japanese central and local government may use green AI in city planning from a legal viewpoint based on three categories. The categories are green AI usage in city planning concerning things, green AI usage in city planning concerning people and green AI usage in city planning concerning automated decision-making. Research limitations: This research is limited to an analysis of Japanese law, which means that issues other than law are not included in this paper. Further, although general legal issues are discussed, this paper is intended to discuss Japanese law issues only, and foreign laws are not discussed. Therefore, this paper mostly cites Japanese language papers published in domestic journals. Practical implications: The intended practical implication of this paper is to allow central and local governments to determine – based on the proposed categories – whether green AI can be used for city planning purposes and under which conditions. The authors hope that this will assist the Japanese government in establishing rules on the usage of AI by governmental agencies and allow for the greater actual usage by Japanese central and local governments of green AI in future city planning. Social implications: As the theme of this paper deals with governmental use (and the function of a government is to serve society), the social implications at issue can be said to be equivalent to the practical implication. Originality/value: There have been articles discussing Japanese administrative law restrictions on AI in general. However, as of now, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, there have been no articles published focusing on green AI used for city planning. The authors note that the green AI used for city planning would have different legal implications from AI’s usage by the government in general, such as the chatbot used by the agencies or lethal autonomous weapons by the military force. Therefore, this paper is original in focusing on green AI used for city planning. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."

It investigates the re-scaling and centralization of the state in directing the investment capital and focuses on the ways in which it reregulates and loosens the institutions to create exceptionalities in order to realize mega projects. It examines Canal Istanbul and the “New City” or the Yenişehir Project, the so-called “crazy project” imposed upon the city by the central government, which presents a crucial case demonstrating the processes of creating exceptionalities and the erosion of public norms. Empirically, drawing from the Turkish experience through an in-depth analysis of policy documents, plans and reports prepared by a variety of agents, the article demonstrates and discusses different modalities of creating exceptions to capitalize on the lucrative real estate markets through mega projects in an increasingly authoritarian neoliberal context, its ramifications on the existing norms and the oppositions it raised. The article concludes with a discussion on how the new political climate that moved away from subsidiarity, transparency and democratic participation, and became increasingly centralized, created an impasse for planning and that neither the ecology nor the economy could be protected and enhanced. Although economic development discourse is used to legitimize these mega projects, it is obvious that they lead to an ecocide. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

However, background research has revealed that these goals and targets are limited because they do not take into account the growing body of lighting-related research in diverse fields on the impact of outdoor illumination on humans, flora and fauna. Recently, exterior lighting has been also linked to environmental degradation and as an indirect contributor to the current climate change emergency. Therefore, this study aims, by using online interviews with over 50 experts who work in the field of artificial light at night (ALAN), to assess whether the SDG objectives adequately reflect the latest knowledge about sustainable cities. The Elsevier 2021 SDG mapping matrix was used to find the correlation between the keywords that define each SDG and the keywords used by a group of international experts. This work suggests there are missing targets in current SDGs, especially SDG 11, connected to sustainable cities and communities. It also offers useful guidance on how to rethink the existing approach of cities that aim for sustainability, by applying eight (8) key aspects of urban lighting for healthier and environmentally responsible outdoor illumination, by means of a correct design process, along with a five-step strategic plan of action. The crucial role of multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary collaboration with experts has also been outlined, via the inclusion of new actors such as lighting professionals and researchers, who are currently absent in this important discourse. © 2022 by the authors.

The designing of the integral part of the society should be focused towards the benefits of people. Internet is extensively utilized by the society using Search Engines. The accuracy and time it takes for different search engines to retrieve information from a cloud computing repository around the world, varies. However, it has been discovered in the literature that webpage ranking reduces the amount of time a user spends surfing, which saves a significant amount of energy during computation and transmission across the network. The hyperlink structure of the web graph is used in most of the earlier solutions documented in the literature, which consumes a lot of energy during calculation. It may exacerbate the link leakage problem by increasing the frequency of spam pages. In light of the energy consumption of various smart gadgets, hyperlink structure alone is no longer sufficient for predicting webpage relevance. Its true importance is revealed by user surfing activity. To improve search engine accuracy and speed, it is critical to demote spam pages, lowering energy consumption. Among all the existing ranking algorithms in the literature, one of the important components is the PageRank algorithm used by Google's ranking module. Keeping focus on these points, in this paper, various page ranking algorithms based upon supervised learning are surveyed and summarized with respect to different selected parameters and experiments performed. Using this information, a detailed taxonomy of search engine results is presented in the text. Moreover, PageRank algorithms are explored by using different supervised learning techniques applied in the existing proposals for getting and processing the results. In the nutshell, the PageRank methodology is surveyed with respect to web spam detection which is the demand of cognitive systems in smart cities. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"

There are many models of the eco-city based mainly on either following the principles of urban ecology or combining the strategies of sustainable cities and the solutions of smart cities. The most prominent among these models are sustainable integrated districts and data-driven smart eco-cities. The latter model represents the unprecedented transformative changes the eco-city is currently undergoing in light of the recent paradigm shift in science and technology brought on by big data science and analytics. This is motivated by the growing need to tackle the problematicity surrounding eco-cities in terms of their planning, development, and governance approaches and practices. Employing a combination of both best-evidence synthesis and narrative approaches, this paper provides a comprehensive state-of-the-art and thematic literature review on sustainable integrated districts and data-driven smart eco-cities. The latter new area is a significant gap in and of itself that this paper seeks to fill together with to what extent the integration of eco-urbanism and smart urbanism is addressed in the era of big data, what driving factors are behind it, and what forms and directions it takes. This study reveals that eco-city district developments are increasingly embracing compact city strategies and becoming a common expansion route for growing cities to achieve urban ecology or urban sustainability. It also shows that the new eco-city projects are increasingly capitalizing on data-driven smart technologies to implement environmental, economic, and social reforms. This is being accomplished by combining the strengths of eco-cities and smart cities and harnessing the synergies of their strategies and solutions in ways that enable eco-cities to improve their performance with respect to sustainability as to its tripartite composition. This in turn means that big data technologies will change eco-urbanism in fundamental and irreversible ways in terms of how eco-cities will be monitored, understood, analyzed, planned, designed, and governed. However, smart urbanism poses significant risks and drawbacks that need to be addressed and overcome in order to achieve the desired outcomes of ecological sustainability in its broader sense. One of the key critical questions raised in this regard pertains to the very potentiality of the technocratic governance of data-driven smart eco-cities and the associated negative implications and hidden pitfalls. In addition, by shedding light on the increasing adoption and uptake of big data technologies in eco-urbanism, this study seeks to assist policymakers and planners in assessing the pros and cons of smart urbanism when effectuating ecologically sustainable urban transformations in the era of big data, as well as to stimulate prospective research and further critical debates on this topic. © 2021, The Author(s)."

Second, we empirically analyzed two Italian municipalities that are experimenting with initiatives of sustainable urban management and planning based on NBSs: The Municipality of Lucca in Tuscany and the Municipality of Latina in the Latium Region. These municipalities present institutional and socioeconomic similarities, making them an interesting study setting that allows us to draw significant lessons. We conducted four research steps: (1) theoretical background analysis, including resilience thinking in sustainable urban management. We investigated the role of NBSs in enabling urban resilience according to the last level of resilience, i.e., the transformative level. (2) We studied the contributions of NBSs to sustainable cities and resilience thinking. (3)We analyzed the NBSs’ projects of Lucca and Latina, and (4) we proposed an urban managerial tool: The NBSs’ curve, which facilitates the estimation of the NBS ecosystem endowment. The results of the NBS initiatives presented in this study have a two-fold value. First, they aim to combine citizens’ well-being with ecological and environmental aspects by better managing urban spaces that facilitate interpersonal relationships and resource sharing. Second, they are developed to meet the needs of local groups by serving as a stimulus (Fridays For Future movement) and as enablers (local associations) of managed actions. The lessons learned about the enhancement of sustainable cities through NBSs were thoroughly debated. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

Specific planning, operation, and thinking can address this problem with the Internet of things (IoT) and Information Communication Technologies (ICT). Existing research provides various solutions and methods for parking systems in the smart city. However, smart parking has many challenges, such as centralization, communication bandwidth, energy efficiency, integrity, security, and privacy. Inspired by Blockchain and AI technology, we propose a Blockchain-enabled Secure Framework for Energy-Efficient Smart Parking in Sustainable City Environment. The transport layer implements the ECC algorithm to encrypt and decrypt the parking zones data for secure communication. The RSU-based-Blockchain network offers authentication and verification of data at the security layer in a distributed manner. Virtualization technology is used for data storage and provides an energy-efficient environment using virtual machines. With Deep LSTM networks, we analyze the parking zone's data and offer the best parking space to the drivers with the best location and timing. We evaluate the proposed architecture using quantitative, qualitative analysis and provide the driver's best parking space. © 2021"

Roofs make up a significant portion of the total area of urban areas. Although green roofs are increasingly being implemented worldwide, there is still a lack of knowledge about choosing the best vegetation for a particular climate that can lead to optimal green roof performance. This study aims to develop a model of selecting the most suitable green roof vegetation under the cold semi-arid climatic conditions of Qazvin city in Iran. In this study, vegetation selection and climatic criteria were identified separately and were approved, weighted and prioritized based on experts' opinions using Likert and AHP questionnaires. Then the data were analyzed using SPSS statistical software. Findings show that among the vegetation selection criteria, economic, energy and environmental criteria, and among climatic ones, the normalization of sundials and temperature regime, are more important, respectively.

Effective policies for healthy and sustainable cities require evidence-informed quantitative targets. We aimed to identify the minimum thresholds for urban design and transport features associated with two physical activity criteria: at least 80% probability of engaging in any walking for transport and WHO's target of at least 15% relative reduction in insufficient physical activity through walking. The International Physical Activity and the Environment Network Adult (known as IPEN) study (N=11 615; 14 cities across ten countries) provided data on local urban design and transport features linked to walking. Associations of these features with the probability of engaging in any walking for transport and sufficient physical activity (≥150 min/week) by walking were estimated, and thresholds associated with the physical activity criteria were determined. Curvilinear associations of population, street intersection, and public transport densities with walking were found. Neighbourhoods exceeding around 5700 people per km2, 100 intersections per km2, and 25 public transport stops per km2 were associated with meeting one or both physical activity criteria. Shorter distances to the nearest park were associated with more physical activity. We use the results to suggest specific target values for each feature as benchmarks for progression towards creating healthy and sustainable cities. © 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Knowledge, guidance, and agreements in this field have led to more willingness, ability, and opportunities among receivers to contribute to efficient and zero-emission city logistics when buying goods and services. Change agents play a vital role by initiating, managing, and implementing the change towards more sustainable processes within organisations. The experiences of change agents in The Netherlands show that the number of initiatives in which governments, universities, businesses, and health care institutions (jointly) use their procurement power to accelerate sustainable city logistics is growing. However, the development towards realisation and scaling in practice is going slowly. For this research, we asked change agents in The Netherlands to discuss together the circumstances and actions that support progress towards sustainable city logistics using the buying power of large (clusters of) organisations in cities. Qualitative data has been collected in three workshops, covering 10 initiatives in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, Utrecht, and Nijmegen. A list of twelve lessons has been derived and compared with the existing literature. Their experiences confirmed that change is supported by knowledge networks, objectives that motivate stakeholders, a strategic vision, a baseline measurement, social pressure, monitoring and communicating progress, market dialogue, and a broad set of measures. The research also provides new recommendations for change agents. They are advised to form a ‘seed-group’, involve a high-ranking ambassador, and actively promote knowledge sharing among peers to increase involvement. Lastly, it has become clear that knowledge on financial feasibility is scarce. This is because every business case is made-to-measure and is barely quantified from the perspective of receivers. © 2022 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

However, little is known about lay people's conception of these constructs. If the urban environment is to be designed to prioritise people, understanding how they conceive of sustainability becomes important. The present study investigated lay people's conceptions of sustainable urban design by asking them to build their own cities with the urban simulation Sim City. In a balanced within-subjects design, participants were asked to create both the least and the most sustainable city they could imagine, whilst expressing their thought processes in a recorded think-aloud protocol. Transcripts were subsequently analysed for common themes which allowed for a comparison between participants' notions of sustainable urban design features and those identified by experts (Jabareen, 2006). This is the first time lay concepts of sustainability have been assessed this way. Participants showed awareness of several urban form factors including compactness, diversity, density, sustainable energy and transport, as well as greenery and mixed land use. The results further suggested that laypeople place particular emphasis on urban design aspects such as energy and transport. A key novel finding was that laypeople also include non-urban design aspects, such as education about the environment, in their notions of sustainability. These findings suggest there might be both mismatches and overlaps between expert and lay concepts of what a sustainable city entails, which in turn might help explain certain failures to engage with sustainable built environments. © 2020 Western Social Science Association."

Yet, existing smart sustainable city projects have concentrated on the technological dimensions of smart cities such as using big data or smart devices to follow sustainability goals. Currently, there is no comprehensive category of smart sustainable city indicators in the literature. This paper aims to discover these indicators by considering the common features of sustainability and smart city concepts. Two rounds of the content analysis technique were employed to investigate semantic, lexical, and conceptual relationships between smart city and sustainability indicators. This paper employed the Sustainable Development Indicators suggested by OECD and the Smart City Index Master by Cohen as the two main groups of indicators. The findings offer a novel set of indicators that enables policymakers and researchers to consider the smartness and sustainability of their projects simultaneously. This includes socio-cultural, economic, environmental, and governance categories with 28 associated indicators. The outcome of this paper offers a unique combined category of smart sustainable city indicators by considering the key elements of sustainability and smart city concepts.

These stories serve as a lens into the diverse ways practitioners produce knowledge about death, healing, disease, and decay as they encounter and transform dead nonhuman bodies. I find that practitioners who work with dead trees develop a circular understanding of death, and propose that decay is needed to heal bodies and remediate land. However, when these everyday embodied knowledges are translated from the level of body to the city, death does not become lively for all. When circular ways of knowing death are applied to the city, death is displaced into vulnerable human and tree bodies showing that the sustainable city both relies on and (re)produces the binaries of life and death. As a contrast, practitioner knowledges of tree death suggest sustainabilities that trouble established notions of life and death, bodies and environments, health and disease, and decay and beauty. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

It is through these principles that are influenced by information and communication technologies (ICT), Internet of Things (IoT), and artificial intelligence, that the practices employed by citizens and their interaction with electronic government (e-government) are diversified. Previously, the misleading concepts of the smart city implied only the objective of the local level or public officials to utilize technology. However, the recent European experience and research studies have led to a more comprehensive notion that refers to the search for intelligent solutions which allow modern sustainable cities to enhance the quality of services provided to citizens and to improve the management of urban mobility. The smart city is based on the usage of connected sensors, data management, and analytics platforms to improve the quality and functioning of built-environment systems. The aim of this paper is to understand the effects of the pandemic on smart cities and to accentuate major exercises that can be learned for post-COVID sustainable urban management and patterns. The lessons and implications outlined in this paper can be used to enforce social distancing community measures in an effective and timely way, and to optimize the use of resources in smart and sustainable cities in critical situations. The paper offers a conceptual overview and serves as a stepping-stone to extensive research and the deployment of sustainable smart city platforms and intelligent transportation systems (a sub-area of smart city applications) after the COVID-19 pandemic using a case study from Russia.

To shed light on the role of urban surfaces in fostering climate resilient and sustainable cities, this paper proposes a catalogue of solutions for the urban surface use. The catalogue presents the main surface uses suitable for the built environment, and discusses the potential conflicts and synergies among them in the view of a multiple and integrated utilization of urban surfaces. Reviewing studies published in the last 15 years, this study aims to answer three major questions: (i) which solutions do exist, (ii) where can these be applied, and (iii) which benefits do they provide. The discussion demonstrates that the use of urban surfaces might lead the development of multiple opportunities for improving the existing urban environments and supporting not only environmental, but also social and economic resilience. Finally, it emphasizes the need for specific quantitative and qualitative approaches to address the multi-disciplinary challenges posed by the design and implementation of surface uses, and the evaluation of their contribution to site-specific objectives. © 2021"

Therefore, it becomes necessary for logistics companies to find high-performance strategies to enhance their sustainability. Collaboration between companies appears as one of the promising solution that improves the freight transport efficiency of modern cities. Existing studies on collaborative transport did not sufficiently account for sustainability aspects and they mainly discuss the independent planning of decision-making problems with economic objectives. However, collaboration an integrated decision-making process can significantly ameliorate the effectiveness of urban transportation systems. This study addresses the issue of sustainable freight transportation planning by formulating and solving a collaborative and integrated two-echelon inventory, location and routing problem (2E-CILRP). The 2E-CILRP is formulated as a multi-objective integer programming model that minimizes logistics costs, CO2 emissions and accident rate. A hybrid heuristic based on machine learning is also introduced to solve the studied problem. The proposed approach combines k-means clustering and genetic algorithms. Comparison of the obtained results with those provided with exact method reveals that the developed approach is more efficient and more practical for designing integrated and collaborative networks with large-sized data. A case study of four agri-food SMEs in France is investigated in order to demonstrate the sustainable benefits of the developed optimization approach. The obtained results suggest that the developed approach can significantly reduce the level of CO2 emissions, logistics costs and accident rate caused by transportation in cities. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"

Reducing vehicle emissions can be done by providing green open spaces. In Kendari City, a potential area for the development of green open space is the Bahteramas General Hospital. Activities in the area and around the Bahteramas General Hospital in Kendari City are quite high so that they contribute to emissions (CO2). The object of research analysis is the number of vehicles (daily traffic), the capacity of electricity use, the area of the Bahteramas General Hospital and the area of the existing green open space. The results showed that the type of vehicle that contributes high to CO2 is a motorcycle. The use of fuel as a source of emission (CO2) which contributes to premium types of greenhouse gases, diesel and the use of electrical energy. The absorption capacity of the existing green open space has not been able to reduce CO2 emissions, so it is necessary to expand the green open space to control greenhouse gases. © 2022, Econjournals.

Much of the pollution and energy consumption is attributed to cities, which are expected to increase in size and population in the coming years. It is therefore necessary to develop systems to make them more sustainable and resilient. In this regard, different agendas, strategies, and regulations have been published, such as the 2030 Agenda. The current research carried out a surveillance and foresight process at the European level in the field of the sustainable city, analyzing actions accomplished, ongoing, or forthcoming from 2014 to the present (2020) and coming years. The objective is to identify the potential niches and opportunities for decision making to develop successful projects in this sector. The study concludes that one of the most promoted themes is related to the environment, highlighting nature and biodiversity in cities to improve environmental quality and achieve the decarbonization necessary to fight climate change. Furthermore, society plays an important role, emphasizing the need to promote the population’s inclusion and empowerment.

However, most of the current energy planning in China pertains to a low-efficient system and proves to be unfriendly to the environment, which is no longer appropriate for the future development of modern industrial parks and cities. Methods: A combined cooling, heating, gas and power energy network with distributed cogeneration units and renewable energy sources provides an effective solution to the related problems. In this paper, a new energy planning method for the Eco-City is proposed, which is based on a Distributed Energy Network (DEN) system. The designed method of a four-stage energy integration mode is implemented, which includes prediction of the energy demand, optimization of the energy utilization, matching of the energy supply and the recovery side. Based on the planning and designing of the DEN, the technical and economic analysis draw reasonable results. Results: As implemented in the practical case of the Sino-German Eco-Park, the procedure of the proposed energy planning method is comprehensively explained. Finally, by reviewing the planning, design and operation, the current state and problems of the Sino-German Eco-Park are described. Conclusions: A new energy design for Eco-Parks is developed as a result of a thorough analysis of the planning process, which integrates city planning and energy planning together and provides energy solutions for high-level cities and industrial parks. The four-stage integrated energy model provides a guideline for the entire process and its detailed steps. Relevant experiences and lessons from the energy planning of the Sino-German Eco-Park are of significance for supporting similar projects in the future. © 2021, The Author(s)."

Countries like Slovakia have not been adequately considering these issues as much as they should. Responding to the opportunity to fill a research gap, primary research has been conducted for this article that seeks i) to use results from previous research to compare currently identified elements influencing the development of a sustainable Smart City concept in Slovakia with best practice cities around the world; and ii) to identify those elements that have achieved a statistically significant correlation with the conceptualisation of Smart Cities in Slovakia. Research data were collected through sociological interrogation, processed in a statistical programme, and subsequently evaluated. The findings point to key elements in developing Smart Cities such as trust, state support and adapting to change. The main output is a general model for conceptualising a Smart City. It can be utilised by strategic city management, fellow researchers and residents of a city implementing it in their own practices. The model reflects social, environmental, technological, and managerial aspects. Further research into the model and subsequent verification are planned in future.  ©The Author(s) 2022."

Notwithstanding their several benefits, including citizens’ psychological, physiological and physical well-being; possibilities for recreational activities; and improved economic attractiveness of a neighborhood, pocket parks (PPs) are not yet widely diffused worldwide. Considering the state of the art of PPs, we identify four main perspectives that characterize them: architectural, microclimate, managerial and legal. Focusing on a relevant case study, i.e., the Mediterranean context, we analyze the multi-disciplinary challenges – connected to the four identified dimensions – for their diffusion elsewhere. Finally, we provide a general framework for favoring PPs’ creation and management, as the original contribution of this work. Besides advancing scientific knowledge about PPs, our results also interest policymakers and public organizations, as the diffusion of PPs can mitigate urban environmental challenges by creating pleasant experiences for citizens and favoring economic activities. © 2021 The Authors"

As ways to imagine and co-design sustainable urban futures, experiments within the present-day urban environment are increasingly popular. This paper investigates how such an experimental approach can serve as the base of an applied urban futures game that enables its players to reflect on and imagine ways to address complex sustainability problems. We developed a large-scale mobile urban futures game, Utrecht2040, that provides its players with sustainability content, reflection, and motivation for action. The digital infrastructure of the game and large number of players provided unique opportunities for measuring outcomes. Our results indicate that this type of experimental gaming offers a new way for players to collect existing sustainable practices or ‘seeds’, and use them to collectively create glimpses into relevant sustainable urban futures. At the individual player level participants reported an increased understanding of sustainability and motivation to act. We conclude that large-scale collective experimental futures games in socio-spatial urban environments are a high-potential avenue for overcoming the “crisis of the imagination” by creating inclusive urban futures that inspire action. © 2021 The Authors"

This research focuses to determine the effect of the different configurations for achieving higher thermal efficiency of the 150 W solar photovoltaic thermal collectors (PV/T). The air-cooling enhancements evaluated in this PV/T system are free duct without fins, ducts with fully transverse fins, partially transverse fins, longitudinal fins with straight baffles and inclined baffles. The experiments are done on hot days of summer in May 2018, India and achieved diverse flow rates of air mass ranging from 0.012 to 0.016 kg/s. The Reynolds number obtained in the flow experiments are in the range of 900–1300 and Nusselt number 35–130.A Computational fluid dynamics study was established to achieve a parametric research to determine surface and outside profiles to study the cooling effectiveness. The impacts on flow rate of air mass on the outlet T, Reynolds Number, coefficient of heat transfer and Nusselt number were studied. The maximum irreversibility occurred at the free type fins whereas minimum irreversibility obtained at longitudinal type with inclined baffles and detected that PV/T system have a prodigious impact on the energy efficacy as well as energy losses increased with increasing surface T. This research displayed that the coefficient of heat transfer of solar panel upsurges by means of growing Reynolds number. Additionally, the PV module thermal efficacy by growing flow rate and reduced with increasing friction factor. An increase by 6–8% in exergy efficiency and 5% to 7% in energy efficiency was recorded while using these forced air-cooling enhancements. A reasonable agreement was reached between experimental and computational model. The exergy performance was increased from 20% to 28 % while using air cooling duct with longitudinal fins and inclined baffles. The thermal energy performance was increased from 12 to 18 % while using air cooling duct with longitudinal fins and inclined baffles. This is the maximum energy efficiency achieved in this PV/T system with the Nusselt number ranging from 30 to 130 and Reynolds number 900–1300. This study showed that Nusselt number of PV/T system upsurges with growing Reynolds number of air flow. The PV module thermal efficacy upsurges by means of growing flow rate as the friction factor increases. The longitudinal fins with inclined baffles provided higher friction factor, thereby ensured higher heat transfer rate. The fins and baffles employed in our research are economical and relaxed to manufacture and install. They bid a fairly lower friction lack in movement of air and henceforth do not necessitate higher fan power. This set up can be used for green and smart cities as it helped to reduce the energy consumption considerably. © 2021"

In this context, those vulnerable groups become unable to benefit from the social, well-being, and overall health benefits of green amenities. To date, despite increasing gentrification and related civic concerns, cities in North America and Europe are still slow to respond. Siloed and reactive planning approaches to (re)development and greening generally do not include housing security and affordability provisions in ways that would be strategic and equity-driven. In this Commentary, we call for further research on the mix of policies and tools that posit multi-sectoral and de-siloed greening agendas in coordination with affordable and stable housing.

Indeed, the rise of such initiatives serves as a sign of renewed attempts to experiment or innovate in designing urban futures in an increasingly urbanized and datafied society. In light of this, a number of alternative models of eco-urbanism have been proposed by scholars and promoted by policy makers. The prominent among these models are sustainable urban districts and data-driven smart eco-cities. At the core of these models is a range of compact and ecological design strategies and static and dynamic conceptions of spatial scaling. These are intended to produce and boost the benefits of sustainability on the basis of a set of integrated approaches—increasingly supported by big data technologies—as a way to overcome new challenges and introduce new solutions. Based on two case studies conducted on three of the ecologically and technologically leading cities in Europe—Stockholm, Malmö, and Barcelona, this paper analyses and discusses the role and relevance of integrating density, mixed land use, greening, and low-energy buildings to the sustainability of emerging eco-districts; the new conceptions of cities and their spatial scales in the context of data-driven smart eco-cities; and the opportunities and challenges of smart urban metabolism with respect to the evaluation of eco-districts. This study shows that combining compact and ecological design strategies improves the performance of eco-districts with respect to the three dimensions of sustainability, as well as paves the way for their balanced integration for producing synergistic effects. Also, this study highlights the innovative potential and enabling role of urban computing and intelligence in transforming the spatial scaling of data-driven smart eco-cities through generating the kind of designs that increase the effects of sustainability as outcomes of processes. Moreover, this study reveals the advantages of the data-driven approach to the analysis of the flows of resources in urban environments in relation to the evaluation of sustainable urban district development. This paper concludes that data-driven smart planning and evaluation holds great potential for facilitating progress towards achieving the goals of sustainability thanks to the proven role and untapped potential of big data technologies in monitoring, understanding, and analyzing urban processes and systems in real-time. © 2021 The Authors"

An important factor in the transformation of a smart city is the development of CMFM clusters and their city logistics nodes (CLNs), the key elements of the logistics system of a megapolis. The primary goal of this study was to examine the role of the CLN4.0, as a lead sustainability and smart service provider of a CMFM cluster within the Industry 4.0 paradigm, as well as its value in the system of logistics facilities and networks of a megalopolis. This paper presents an innovative model of a CLN4.0 under supply uncertainty using a material flow analysis (MFA) methodology, which allows for specific parameters of throughput capacity within the CMFM cluster and the management of supply chains (SCs) under uncertainty. The model was verified based on a case study (7th scenario) for various frameworks of a multi-floor CLN4.0. The validity of using a group of virtual CLNs4.0 to support the balanced operation of these framework operations under uncertainty, due to an uneven production workload of CMFM clusters, is discussed. The results may be useful for the decision-making and planning processes associated with supply chain management (SCM) within CMFM clusters in a megapolis. © 2021 by the authors."

We performed spatial analyses and quantified the supply and trade-offs between 23 ES (grouped into three categories: provisioning, regulating, and supporting) from UPF in the Karlsruhe region, southwest Germany. The supply of ES was calculated, normalized, and mapped from field data collected at 201 randomly selected plots in UPF, located in agricultural land, built-up areas (i.e., artificial surfaces), and forest and seminatural areas. Trade-offs were calculated as the root mean squared error between the benefits from two categories of ES. Predominantly, there was a synergy between provisioning and regulating ES; however, trade-offs with supporting ecosystem services were detected in all three land-uses. The UPF areas with a high supply of supporting ES (e.g. tree species, structural and tree microhabitat diversity) had a lower supply of regulating and provisioning ES, resulting in trade-offs. This study demonstrates trade-off patterns between the ES in UPF, which should be considered in the management of UPF and sustainable city design.

The FM/LM problem in Stockholm County, Sweden, was evaluated using a Geographic Information System estimating distances to public transport for the years 2019 and 2035. Overall, the population in Stockholm County, have good access to public transport. However, access varies with abilities, with elderly having 50 percent and elderly impaired 15 percent of their area within walking distance to public transport compared with the average citizen. Planned developments can provide good access to public transport, with extensive improvements for the elderly. However, inadequate planning for population increase will likely decrease the perceived public transport accessibility. Apartments and commercial buildings in the study area have high access to public transport. Elderly people have good access within city and regional centers, while access could be improved in other areas. Inclusion of FM/LM in the planning support system used in Stockholm could help mitigate FM/LM problems and extend access to public transport to all people of different abilities. This is vital in creating sustainable mobility networks and achieving sustainable development in smart cities. © 2022 The Author(s).

Yet vacant land mapping faces the challenges of confusing terminology, reliance on inefficient registration systems, and the cost of data collection. Automatic site detection has been attempted using classification of remote sensing images. However, because the morphology of vacant land can cover such diverse aspects as derelict structures, bare soil, and vegetation or a mix thereof, even when commercial high-resolution images are used, it remains difficult to achieve this goal. This study starts by defining an urban vacant land typology suitable for automatic site detection. It covers four categories: transportation-associated land; natural sites with unfavorable conditions such as wetlands, steep slopes, or riverbanks; unattended areas or reserve parcels as “leftover spaces” within the urban fabric; and brownfield sites previously used but now abandoned. The study goes on to describe the rule-based data fusion method applied for site detection. The fusion procedure combines remote sensing images, GIS layers and citizen science data. For each type of vacant land, a separate data processing flow was developed. The method was tested in 63 urban and rural districts in Germany, identifying a large number of vacant sites. The study used an open-source approach. Open-source spatial data was collected for analysis, aerial photos provided by open-data projects were used for quality checks, and free software was used for data processing. This means that, information on vacant land is retrievable by local administrations irrespective of their financial circumstances. Depending on local urban development strategies, the detected sites can be used to support different sustainability goals. © 2021"

However, most urban indicator frameworks use coarse spatial scales that either only allow between-city comparisons, or require expensive, technical, local spatial analyses for within-city comparisons. This study developed a reusable, open-source urban indicator computational framework using open data to enable consistent local and global comparative analyses. We show this framework by calculating spatial indicators—for 25 diverse cities in 19 countries—of urban design and transport features that support health and sustainability. We link these indicators to cities’ policy contexts, and identify populations living above and below critical thresholds for physical activity through walking. Efforts to broaden participation in crowdsourcing data and to calculate globally consistent indicators are essential for planning evidence-informed urban interventions, monitoring policy effects, and learning lessons from peer cities to achieve health, equity, and sustainability goals. © 2022 The Author(s).

Katharina Pistor’s seminal book The Code of Capital pointed out that our current form of capitalism is enabled by private law, which selectively ‘codes’ certain assets, endowing them with the capacity to protect and produce private wealth. Law can be changed by the legislature, but legal concepts can equally be imbued with new meanings due to changing ways of seeing in society. Indeed, our investigation into two legal innovations – the Community Land Trust (CLT) and the Zoöp model – demonstrates how little change of the legal hardware of society is required for meaningful legal change in service of sustainability in the city and beyond. Whereas the CLT rethinks the stewardship function of property rights, the Zoöp model transforms corporate governance structures to consider nonhumans’ interests – and both do so without waiting for relevant legal changes to be enacted by legislatures. To evaluate the potential and the limitations of these two legal innovations, we assess the extent to which these innovations align with four ‘glocal’ lenses of the Doughnut model developed by the British economist Kate Raworth: To what extent to these legal innovations support the thriving of humans and environment both locally and globally? © 2022, Boom Uitgevers.

Active solutions commonly used to improve comfort level in buildings may increase energy consumption, which hinders the sustainable development of cities. It is of great significance to balance the comfort and energy during the building design phase. Passive solutions present the potential in energy saving, such as glass curtain wall. However, it is difficult to ensure thermal stability in building because of the unsteady heat exchange through glass curtain wall, further affecting the balance. In this work, transitional space consisting of glass façade, i.e., green glass space (GGS), between indoor and outdoor environments is proposed to achieve a favorable balance. The impacts of design parameters (i.e., height and angle of green glass space) are investigated on both thermal comfort and energy efficiency, which are carried out in a case study. Numerical simulation is validated by experimental data. Air distribution performance index (ADPI) and percentage of dissatisfied (PD) are used as indicators to evaluate thermal comfort. Energy saving coefficient is put forward as an index for energy efficiency of green glass space. Results showed that (1) green glass space can decrease heating energy consumption by approximately 50% compared with non-green glass spaces, (2) air distribution performance index is above 85% and percentage of dissatisfied is below 1% at various heights and angles, and (3) optimal design parameters of green glass space are achieved at a height of 0.9 H (H is the building height) and an angle of 90° This study can provide an important reference of design strategy for the sustainable development of green building and cities. © 2022"

The growing popularity of IoT opens up new possibilities, and one of the most notable applications is related to the evolving sustainable city paradigm. A sustainable city is normally designed in such a way to consider the environmental impact and a social, economic, and resilient habitat for existing populations without compromising the ability of future generations to experience the same, while the process of managing project requirements is known as requirements management. To design a high-quality project, effective requirements management is imperative. A number of techniques are already available to perform the requirement gathering process, and software developers apply them to collect the requirements. Nevertheless, they are facing many issues in gathering requirements due to a lack of literature on the selection of appropriate methods, which affects the quality of the software. The software design quality can be improved by using requirements capture and management techniques. Some tools are used to comprehend the system accurately. In this paper, a qualitative comparison of requirements-gathering tools using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and requirements-management tools is presented for sustainable cities. With all the tools and techniques available for capturing and managing requirements, it has been proven that software developers have a wide range of alternatives for selecting the best tool that fits their needs, such as chosen by the AI agent.

This paper will review urban residents' perceptions of the ways that sustainable cities are being planned and produced in Malaysia. In particular, this article analyses urban residents' perceptions of planners' roles in the context of diverse aspirations for sustainable cities. Data collected from in-depth interviews and survey revealed that the communication between urban residents and planners tends to be 'one way' and there are 'too many' unnecessary political intervention in planning for sustainable cities. Although public participation allows urban residents to participate in the planning process, the residents' opinions tend to be ignored as there is a minority but a powerful and affluent group that dominated the process. Our data also revealed that neighbourhood planning tends to include 'everything' under the umbrella of sustainability, but with little practical execution on the ground. Thus, we can conclude that the implementation of sustainable development is still a challenge in Malaysian cities.  © 2021 Oxford University Press and Community Development Journal.

Unsustainable urbanization will generate multidimensional impacts on the earth’s socio-ecological system that is nearly impossible to be managed. As a preemptive action, urban sustainability has been considered as one of the most important targets in the Sustainable Development Goals. Within this context, the green city has emerged as a widely adopted concept around the globe. In the Global North, the concept of a green city has been incrementally developed as efforts to mainstream green infrastructure and nature-based solutions approaches in supporting ecosystem services. Quite the contrary, in the Global South cities, due to their rapid and vast urbanization process, the green city has been fragmentally adopted. Previous studies have proposed three factors, i.e., urbanization, biophysics, and governance, underlying the different approaches of green city development between cities in the Global North and South. Still, more studies are needed to explicate these factors and how these will in turn shape a particular green city trajectory in Global South cities. This study aims to respond to these questions based on green city experimentation in Indonesia. An exploratory study was done based on a literature review and participant observation. The results exhibit that the green city program in Indonesia largely focused on the development of green open spaces which has ultimately failed to improve the urban environment and sustainability. Incorporating local socio-ecological aspects coupled with integrated multi-level and multi-actors’ governance is recommended to increase the green city performances.

Afterward, scholars gradually increased attention to the resilience evaluation of urban road networks. Therefore, we proposed a resilience assessment framework of the urban road networks, including the resilience performance index, the robustness index, and the recovery index. Then we simulated the cascading failure based on a nonlinear load-capacity model with two capacity control parameters: α and β. Results show that the intersection-based attack has the most significant impact on resilience, and resilience is positively correlated with the node degree of the attacked intersection. The increase of α and β could enhance the resilience, and the urban road network achieves the best resilience performance when α=0.3,β=0.5. Compared with the deliberate attack strategy, the resilience performance under the random attack strategy is more robust. This research can provide the foundation for optimizing urban road networks and multi-mode urban public transit networks. © 2021 Elsevier B.V."

Concurrently, there has been a sea change in the domain of Earth observation (EO) where scientific and technological breakthroughs are accompanied by a paradigm shift in the provision of open and free data. While the urban and EO communities share the end goal of achieving sustainability, cities still lack an understanding of the value EO can bring in this direction, an next a consolidated framework for tapping the full potential of EO and integrating it in their operational modus operandi. The “SMart URBan Solutions for air quality, disasters and city growth” H2020 project (SMURBS/ERA-PLANET) sits at this scientific and policy crossroad, and, by creating bottom-up EO-driven solutions against an array of environmental urban pressures, and by expanding the network of engaged and exemplary smart cities that push the state-of-the-art in EO uptake, brings the international ongoing discussion of EO for sustainable cities closer to home and contributes in this discussion. This paper advocates for EO as an integral part of a smart and sustainable city and aspires to lead by example. To this end, it documents the project's impacts, ranging from the grander policy fields to an evolving portfolio of smart urban solutions and everyday city operations, as well as the cornerstones for successful EO integration. Drawing a parallel with the utilization of EO in supporting several aspects of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, it aspires to be a point of reference for upcoming endeavors of city stakeholders and the EO community alike, to tread together, beyond traditional monitoring or urban planning, and to lay the foundations for urban sustainability. © 2022 The Authors"

This study examines the driving forces behind urbanization and its impact on social, economic and environment areas. The research helps to establish the sustainable city planning, after evaluation of specific challenges of zones, and this mitigation will optimize government investment and reduce cost. Design/methodology/approach: Bengaluru is used as a study area to examine the interaction of migration and urban development. The study covers the period between 2011 and 2019. Panel data analysis is applied to measure the effect of urban development indicators on urban migration. The authors applied the integrated urban metabolism analysis tool to quantify the urban development indicators and identified the most critical areas for migrants. Later, authors proposed mitigation measures based on alternate scenario approach. Findings: The authors found that there is a mixed effect of urban migration on urban development across various zones in Bengaluru. Besides, the authors suggest how planned collaboration should play a significant role in urban planning and optimize city planning judiciously. Effective mitigation measures should be developed based on zone-specific core issues, and practical trainings, research, public awareness campaigns and skill up-gradation of migrants would enhance the socio-economic and environmental conditions. Research limitations/implications: The study will support the ongoing and upcoming initiatives launched by the Government of India i.e. Awas Yojna, Atmanirbhar Bharat and Swach Bharat. Practical implications: The structured city planning suggested in the study will help to save wastage of resources and cost and time of developers and policymakers. This will also help to upgrade the status of migrants and enhance the ambience of city around social, economic and environment fronts. Originality/value: The first of its kind of innovative model mapped in the study area establishes a link between strategic city planning under rural–urban migration and urban development. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited."

Small-scale wind power offers new opportunities for decentralized electricity production, avoiding dependence on the grid and transmission losses. Among viable locations within the urban environment, high-rise buildings are especially promising due to the elevated height and less turbulent wind conditions. They can also be integrated into the architecture of the building or as independent units in the urban environment. In this area, this work presents a methodology for determining the annual energy production of urban wind projects.

The latter group exploits abandoned and degraded urban niches which, in the case of plants, form what is called the third landscape. In the Anthropocene, cities, open spaces and buildings must be planned and designed considering not only human needs but also those of other living organisms. The scientific approach of habitat sharing is defined as reconciliation ecology, whilst the action of implementing the ecosystem services and functioning of such anthropogenic habitats is called Urban Rehabilitation. However, urban development still represents the main cause of biodiversity loss worldwide. Yet, the approach of planners and landscape architects highly diverges from that of ecologists and scientists on how to perceive, define and design urban green and blue infrastructure. For instance, designers focus on the positive impact that nature (generally associated with indoor and outdoor greeneries) has on human well-being, often neglecting ecosystems’ health. Instead, considering the negative impact of any form of development and to achieve the no net loss Aichi’s objectives, conservationists apply mitigation hierarchy policies to avoid or reduce the impact and to offset biodiversity. The rationale of this review paper is to set the fundamentals for a multidisciplinary design framework tackling the issue of biodiversity loss in the urban environment by design for nature. The method focuses on the building/city/landscape scales and is enabled by emerging digital technologies, i.e., geographic information systems, building information modelling, ecological simulation and computational design. © 2021, The Author(s)."

Climate change, biodiversity loss and increasing spatial segregation are testament to this. The effects of these issues often exceed the coping capacity of individual urban housing developers. Thus, an antidote to the current neoliberal trend must be found in collaborations such as public-private partnerships (PPP). Here the shortcomings and limitations of PPP and its potential ability to solve the problem of unsustainable urban development are investigated. Using the Doughnut Economics (DE) model as a general guide, a systematic literature review is conducted. The results reveal evidence that PPPs are unjust and exclude local actors from collaborations. Hence, resident participation and inclusion is considered the best strategy for PPP to evolve as a future guarantor of the sustainable city. First, however, major differences in the character of issues that connect the global model of sustainability to the harsh reality of the local context need to be addressed. This gap concerns the city’s social foundation and ecological ceiling. The DE model applied herein is an excellent tool to test the scope and depth of local collaborations such as PPPs and reflect on international treaties such as SDGs. © 2021 by the authors.

A number of studies confirm that poverty in urban space is accompanied by negative phenomena, such as high unemployment, social pathologies, increased crime rate, or the high level of the decapitalization of space, including the poor condition of housing and municipal infrastructure. However, there is a gap in defining the relation between urban poverty and city structure to control and preferably minimize social inequalities. The aim of the study was to empirically verify the impact of the location of residential properties in relation to poverty-stricken areas in the city. The research covered the housing market in one Polish city (Kalisz) in the years 2006-2018. By applying GIS technologies, we identified the location of each property in relation to poverty areas. The data was subjected to regression analysis, with the use of the hedonic approach based on exponential models. The analysis of data allowed us to conclude that location in a poorer area does affect the prices of new flats, which is not only a contribution to the development of science, but is also information that could be used by developers or property valuers to establish the prices of flats, as well as city managers to avoid pauperization of urban districts. © 2021 by the authors.

While firms benefit from local production externalities, households commute to their workplaces with private vehicles and exert a local pollution externality on the residents living along the urban transport networks. The spatial location of firms and residents endogenously results from the trade-off between the production and pollution externalities and the commuting costs. The analysis shows that in monocentric cities the benefits associated with a fall in per-vehicle pollution are absorbed by rents paid to absentee landlords. When a city includes business and residential districts as well as a district mixing both agents, a lower per-vehicle pollution enlarges the residential districts and shifts the business districts closer to the geographical center of the city. The paper finally studies the optimal city structure. The first-best policies that fully internalize the externalities still foster business agglomeration. © 2021 The Authors"

PEDs are understood as districts that achieve a positive energy balance on an annual basis by means of exporting more energy than is consumed within their limits. The main issue to standardize the concept, besides which characteristics should be considered, is that current standards to calculate an energy balance are not applied at the district level. This paper reviews the current standards and adapts them to propose an energy balance calculation methodology. Calculation of an energy balance at the district level is complex since it includes several parameters, such as which loads (or elements) should be included, which renewable energy technologies should be considered on-site production, and which primary energy factors should be used. The proposed methodology is thought to help cities at the design stage of a district and to evaluate its annual energy balance. The methodology is performed in eight steps, and all the needed assumptions that affect the calculation of the annual energy balance are discussed in each step. © 2021 by the authors.

This study aims to raise urban food security with less use of public water and energy in food production, through utilizing green water and energy for sustainable management. A system dynamics (SD) model framed across the nexus of climate, water, energy and food (WEF) sectors is developed for a rooftop farm in Taipei City of Taiwan. The urban WEF Nexus is structured to address how local weather affects water and energy utilization to grow vegetables. The SD results showed that the annual yields of sweet potato leaves achieved 9.3 kg/m2, at the cost of 3.8 ton/m2 of harvested rainwater and 2.1 ton/m2 of tap water together with 2.1 kwh/m2 of solar photovoltaic power and 0.4 kwh/m2 of public electricity. This study not only demonstrates that green resources show great potential to make a significant reduction in consuming urban irrigation resources for rooftop farming, but contributes to urban planning through a sustainable in situ WEF Nexus mechanism at a city scale. The WEF Nexus can manifest the rooftop farming promotion as cogent development to facilitate urban sustainability. © 2021, MDPI AG. All rights reserved."

Although there is substantial information about ‘the speed in which we are falling off the cliff’ with respect to the negative effects of climate change, biodiversity loss, and nitrogen and phosphorus overuse, much less is known about how humanity may transition to living within sustainable ecological and social boundaries. Transitioning to global sustainability requires a framework that integrates both fundamental ecological boundaries with social foundations that provide basic needs. One such framework is Raworth’s Doughnut Model, where the doughnut indicates a ‘sweet spot’: Meeting basic social needs of all within sustainable boundaries for earth-systems processes. While there are a global and a few national level analyses of sustainability using this framework, there are no regional level assessments. We used Raworth’s Doughnut Model to assess regional level sustainability for a mid-sized metropolitan area in the Midwestern United States. We pooled county data from government and non-profit reports to quantify social foundation and ecological boundary sustainability across one of the most populous regions in the upper Midwestern United States. Our regional doughnut analysis revealed many ecological overshoots and social deficits, and identified key areas for urban, peri-urban and rural sustainability collaborations. Our analysis also revealed the importance of geospatial variation in ecological boundary overshoot and social deficits. In many ways, our study system of the upper Midwestern United States is representative of city sizes of the future and understanding these trajectories of ecological and social parameters may inform future global sustainable pathways. © 2021 WIT Press."

The above multi-objective logistics infrastructure capacity investment and CO2 emission taxes problem is formulated as a bi-level goal programming model. Given the priority structure of the goals, the total deviations from predetermined goals are minimized in the upper level, while the lower level of the model serves as the service route choice equilibrium problem of logistics users. To solve the proposed model, a genetic algorithm is developed, where the method of successive average (MSA) is embedded. The case study focusing on the urban logistics network of Changsha, China demonstrates the effectiveness of the bi-level goal programming model and the genetic algorithm. The findings reveal that the priority rankings of the goals have a significant impact on the joint decisions of CO2 emission taxes and logistics infrastructure capacity investment.

Here, we demonstrate that many people believe neither that such areas are greener nor that these are desirable places to live. Through brief photo elic-itation interviews and a focus group, we examine the imaginary of “green city” in a politically conservative area. Our findings suggest residents do support environmentalism, and believe their local area embodies much of what it means to be “green”, including a strong sense of community, a lifestyle deeply connected to the local environment, and a desire to take part in sustainability initiatives. Big cities, in contrast, are imagined as both less green and less desirable places to live. We suggest that the dominant US American urban environmental imaginary remains alienating to many and reflect on the implications of these divergent imaginaries for environmental politics. Emphasizing the multiplicity of environmental imaginaries helps us to understand conservative areas not necessarily as anti-environmental but as articulating views that do not accord with dominant perspectives; this might also point us towards more diverse possibilities for sustainable futures. © 2021, University of North Carolina Press.

Based on the comprehensive scoring of various indexes and the superposition analysis of elements such as current buildings and water systems, the analysis of ecological sensitivity and site suitability was obtained, and a more optimal development and construction plan was proposed accordingly. Based on the GIS model, the area with ecological sensitivity index below 4 is identified as about 167.4 hectares, the valley area along the water system has the highest sensitivity and should be avoided for development and construction, and the mildly sensitive area should be developed and constructed with the principle of minimum interference. The unsuitable construction area is about 65.7 hectares, except for the river mostly for the area where the slope of the site is more than 25 %. Combining the topographic features to determine the low-impact road selection and building layout, different design strategies are proposed for hilltops, ridges, valleys and saddles, and the elevation difference of the site is solved by using staircases to carry out the building layout of a high building on high ground and low building on low ground.

Today, many homes in poor condition do not meet the basic requirements for residential environments in the current framework. Theoretical models for the urban evaluation of this phenomenon are a necessary starting point for urban renewal and sustainability. This study aims to generate a model for evaluating homes in a situation of social inequality (hereinafter Vrs) with indicators on physical, spatial, environmental, and social aspects. The methodology used in this study evaluates housing, taking into consideration habitability factors (physical, spatial, and constructive characteristics), as well as the qualitative characteristics assessing the satisfaction of users with the adaptation and transformation of the housing and its surroundings. The application of 51 indicators distributed in four previous parameters was established for this study. This quantification identifies the deficiencies of the dwellings and sets the guidelines for the establishment of future rehabilitation policies for adapting the dwellings to current and emergency scenarios. The innovation of this study is the construction of a tool for social research surveys designed to include individual indicators from the dwellings’ users, to provide a more dependable representation of the problems found in Vrs. The results of this research identified the deficiencies of precarious housing and could be used for applying effective proposals for improvement of habitability and their surroundings in the future. Furthermore, the results showed that when all the indicators were considered, the level of lag reached would be similar to that of a real housing situation, further confirming the suitability of the methodology applied in this investigation. © 2021 by the authors.

The findings from the SEM are in line with the IPA’s concept in that, to ensure resident satisfaction and loyalty, the quadrant that requires the most attention is Q1, while Q2 stands as the target quadrant. Implications and future research directions are proposed based on the findings. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

Green IoT applications based on Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are developed in various domains, such as medical, engineering, industry, and smart cities to grow the production. To increase the performance of sustainable cities, communicating nodes are interconnected autonomously to observe the environment, where they need to be more energy-efficient. Edge computing operates in a distributed manner and improves the response time with the least latency through various edge servers. Although the integration of edge computing and Green IoT significantly improves the network performance in terms of computation and data storage, low powered sensors have constraints in terms of battery power, low transmission range, and security aspects. Therefore, adopting an emerging solution is needed to offer energy services with secure data delivery for sustainable cities. This paper presents an intelligent and secure edge-enabled computing (ISEC) model for sustainable cities using Green IoT, which aims to develop the communication strategy with decreasing the liability in terms of energy management and data security for data transportation. The proposed model generates optimal features using deep learning for data routing, which may help to train the sensors for predicting the finest routes toward edge servers. Moreover, the integration of distributed hashing with chaining strategy eases security solutions with efficient computing system. The experimental results reveal the improved performance of the proposed ISEC model against other solutions for energy consumption by 21 %, network throughput by 15 %, end-to-end delay by 12 %, route interruption by 36 %, and network overhead by 52 %. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"

Owing to the challenges faced by cities worldwide to accommodate the growing urban populations, it is becoming ever more important for innovative research on sustainable urban development to be performed to help cities achieve sustainability. This study develops and tests an integrated approach to sustainable city assessment, which is a combination of importance-performance analysis (IPA) and modified analytic hierarchy process (AHP). Questionnaires designed following the IPA concept were distributed to residents of three cities. The importance scores from the collected data were factorized and the factors’ relative scores were then calculated using a formula developed in this study to represent pairwise comparisons. The derived criteria weights were applied to the performance scores to evaluate the cities’ relative overall sustainability performance. This approach replaces the AHP’s 1–9 scale with the IPA’s importance rating scale, which is a Likert scale, in the questionnaire.

As a result, we highlight that the Fourth Industrial Revolution will have implications on several factors that are deeply connected to the success of cities in becoming sustainable: job creation, industries, innovation, environmental preservation, community involvement, and accessibility. In this context, policymakers will have opportunities and challenges that must be faced. Big data, the IoT, augmented reality, and simulations can have positive and negative externalities. Positive externalities include new information that could be mined, analyzed, and used for identifying previously unseen problems, the provision of new industrial innovations that can make economies thrive, helping promote inclusion for disabled people, as well as helping society to foresee problems and hence adapt to them in a timely manner. © 2021 by the authors.

In this study, we propose to tackle a novel transit mobility structure detection problem, which hinges on high-level mobility patterns that characterize collective movement dynamics across the study region. To this end, we propose a machine learning-based approach to discover meaningful urban mobility structure using big transit data. We contend that both transit mobility patterns and local urban function information should be considered during the detection of transit mobility structure. By integrating different sources of urban data, we model the network of transit mobility as an attributed graph: local static urban functions are described by attributed features for graph nodes whereas travel dynamics are captured via a transit mobility pattern matrix. Similarities of both attributed features and transit mobility patterns are jointly embedded to derive compact low-dimensional vector representations via graph auto-encoder. Mobility structure is then extracted using unsupervised clustering and gap statistics. The proposed approach is capable of synthesizing both mobility and static information in a data-driven manner, preserving original urban topological structure and resident movement dynamics. The proposed approach was evaluated using real-world transit data collected in Shenzhen City, China. Experimental results and analyses demonstrate that the proposed approach has the applicability of unveiling meaningful transit mobility structure in large metropolitan areas. The detected mobility community maps present a holistic overview of public transit movement structure, enabling decision makers to make informed decisions on sustainable urban development and transit management. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"

Improving the energy efficiency of the various infrastructures that make up cities is one aspect being considered when improving their sustainability, with Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs) being one of them. Consequently, this study aims to conceive, tune, and evaluate a set of candidate deep learning models with the goal being to forecast the energy consumption of a WWTP, following a recursive multi-step approach. Three distinct types of models were experimented, in particular, Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), and uni-dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Uni-and multi-variate settings were evaluated, as well as different methods for handling outliers. Promising forecasting results were obtained by CNN-based models, being this difference statistically significant when compared to LSTMs and GRUs, with the best model presenting an approximate overall error of 630 kWh when on a multi-variate setting. Finally, to overcome the problem of data scarcity in WWTPs, transfer learning processes were implemented, with promising results being achieved when using a pre-trained uni-variate CNN model, with the overall error reducing to 325 kWh. © 2021 by the authors.

Then, according to the analysis results, the spatial information characteristics of the green urban ecological plant landscape were extracted, and then the plant landscape spatial coordination planning model was constructed. Based on the coordinated planning model of plant landscape space, the coordinated planning of green urban ecological plant landscape space is finally realized.

This article develops an analysis of urban agriculture as a complex site of governance in which numerous interests engage. We underscore the politics of governance, through which some actors resist the imposition of a narrowly normative and exclusive notion of urban agriculture and against which they envision and enact alternatives. The article contributes to efforts to transcend the often dichotomous framing of urban agriculture as radical or neoliberal, formal or informal, political or post-political by employing ‘everyday governance’ and ‘everyday resistance’ as lenses through which to focus on the prosaic practices of engaging with, pushing back against, and stepping beyond the imposition of hegemonic models of urban agriculture. We argue that the co-constitutive, ‘braided’ nature of urban agricultural governance is revealed through attention to the manifold forms of negotiation and resistance to formal urban agricultural governance.

The pandemic has an influential impact on almost everything and the characteristics of the pandemic remain unclear. This ultimately leads to ineffective strategic planning to manage the pandemic. This study aims to elucidate the typical pandemic characteristics in line with various temporal phases and its associated measures that proved effective in controlling the pandemic. Besides, an insight into diverse country's approaches towards pandemic and their consequences is provided in brief. Understanding the role of technologies in supporting humanity gives new perspectives to effectively manage the pandemic. Such role of technologies is expressed from the viewpoint of seamless connectivity, rapid communication, mobility, technological influence in healthcare, digitalization influence, surveillance and security, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Internet of Things (IoT). Furthermore, some insightful scenarios are framed where the full-fledged implementation of technologies is assumed, and the reflected pandemic impacts in such scenarios are analyzed. The framed scenarios revolve around the digitalized energy sector, an enhanced supply chain system with effective customer-retailer relationships to support the city during the pandemic scenario, and an advanced tracking system for containing virus spread. The study is further extended to frame revitalization strategies to highlight the expertise where significant attention needs to be provided in the post-pandemic period as well as to nurture sustainable development. Finally, the current pandemic scenario is analyzed in terms of occurred changes and is mapped into SWOT factors. Using Fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution based Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis, these SWOT factors are analyzed to determine where prioritized efforts are needed to focus so as to traverse towards sustainable cities. The results indicate that the enhanced crisis management ability and situational need to restructure the economic model emerges to be the most-significant SWOT factor that can ultimately support humanity for making the cities sustainable. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"

Energy is one of the key requirements of EVs, not only to support the smooth and sustainable operation of EVs, but also to ensure connectivity between the vehicle and the infrastructure in the critical times such as disaster recovery operation. In this context, renewable energy sources (such as wind energy) have an important role to play in the automobile sector towards designing energy-harvesting electric vehicles (EH-EV) to mitigate energy reliance on the national grid. In this article, a novel approach is presented to harness energy from a small-scale wind turbine due to vehicle mobility to support the communication primitives in electric vehicles which enable plenty of IoV use cases. The harvested power is then processed through a regulation circuitry to consequently achieve the desired power supply for the end load (i.e., battery or super capacitor). The suitable orientation for optimum conversion efficiency is proposed through ANSYS-based aerodynamics analysis. The voltage-induced by the DC generator is 35 V under the no-load condition while it is 25 V at a rated current of 6.9 A at full-load, yielding a supply of 100 W (on constant voltage) at a speed of 90 mph for nominal battery charging. © 2021 by the authors.

Nowadays, most of the literature explores the concept of smart cities from the point of view of information and communications technology, indeed, the connection with the sustainability aspects of the food supply chain and the ways to operationalize that, remains unsolved. This paper tries to overcome this gap in the literature. The main aim is to analyze the contribution of the short supply chain of food in terms of sustainability in smart cities, regarding current urban trends in cities in general and in Mediterranean areas in particular. The methodology was based on a literature review and includes quantitative and qualitative analysis. The results confirm the existence of positive impacts in the short supply chains of food in urban areas in terms of sustainability. Despite the existence of a considerable number of papers about smart cities and ICT-related topics, the benefits from society of short supply chains of food, and the linkage among the topics and subjects, remain unreferred to or with a limited knowledge exchange. The conclusions of this paper will be helpful for public decision makers to implement policies in order to promote the sustainability of Mediterranean cities. © 2021 by the author(s)."

Despite valuable research contributions that represent fundamental knowledge on this topic, today's body of research appears quite fragmented in relation to the role of micro-mobility as a transformative solution for meeting sustainability outcomes in urban environments. This paper consolidates knowledge on the topic, analyses past and on-going research developments, and provides future research directions by using a rigorous and auditable systematic literature review methodology. To achieve these objectives, the paper analysed 328 journal publications from the Scopus database covering the period between 2000 and 2020. A bibliographic analysis was used to identify relevant publications and explore the changing landscape of micro-mobility research. The study constructed and visualised the literature's bibliometric networks through citations and co-citations analyses for authors, articles, journals and countries. The findings showed a consistent spike in recent research outputs covering the sustainability aspects of micro-mobility reflecting its importance as a low-carbon and transformative mode of urban transport. The co-citation analysis, in particular, helped to categorise the literature into four main research themes that address benefits, technology, policy and behavioural mode-choice categories where the majority of research has been focused during the analysis period. For each cluster, inductive reasoning is used to discuss the emerging trends, barriers as well as pathways to overcome challenges to wide-scale deployment. This article provides a balanced and objective summary of research evidence on the topic and serves as a reference point for further research on micro-mobility for sustainable cities. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"

Especially, since industrial sewage is normally highly toxic, which could cause serious pollution in a city and lead to health problems of residents, it is critical to monitor and predictably maintain sewage treatment facilities in cities. This paper presents an intelligent sewage treatment system based on machine learning and Internet of Things sensors to assist to manage the sewage treatment in a fine chemical plant. The implemented system has operated for twenty months, acquired multi-dimension data such as temperatures in different treatment processes, operation parameters of devices, and real-time Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD). Since the change trend of outflow COD is highly related to operation status, this paper innovatively uses different types of temperature and water inflow data as model inputs and applies three algorithms to make prediction, which are Support Vector Regression (SVR), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural network. The experimental results show that GRU model performs better (MAPE = 10.18%, RMSE = 35.67, MAE = 31.16) than LSTM and SVR. This study can be extended to various sewage treatment scenarios in sustainable cities. © 2021"

These initiatives have involved the implementation of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) as a good driver for achieving sustainability because digital transformation can boost sustainable development strategies, providing opportunities to accelerate transformation. Smart City (SC) models built on empowering people in making public decisions favor access to sustainable development solutions based on knowledge and innovation. Nonetheless, SC experiences around the world denote divergent conceptions of SCs which could lead to different SCs construction. It deserves a more thorough understanding of the nature of collaboration in different settings. Therefore, this paper contributes to the debate on the different uses of ICTs in SCs construction in developing vs. developed countries, by examining the use of ICTs for creating collaborative environments in a sample of SCs in different countries, depending on their economic level, and seeking to identify differences in the objectives pursued by city governments with the use of these technologies. To achieve this aim, e-participation platforms, apps or social media platforms (European and Central Asia SCs) are examined for identifying SCs construction differences between developed vs. developing countries. The findings of this paper put an emphasis on the need for taking into account the differences among SCs in developed vs. developing countries when raking or when performance measurement is designed, because the assessment should be tailored to the cities’ particular visions and priorities for achieving their objectives. © 2021 by the authors.

Cycling helps to reduce air pollution and traffic congestion, and so, it is one of the simplest ways to lower the environmental footprint of people. However, the cohabitation of cars and vulnerable road users, such as bikes, scooters, or pedestrians, is prone to cause accidents with serious consequences. In this context, technological solutions are sought that enable the generation of alerts to prevent these accidents, thereby promoting a safer city for these road users, and a cleaner environment. Alert systems based on smartphones can alleviate these situations since nearly all people carry such a device while traveling. In this work, we test the suitability of a smartphone based alert system, determining the most adequate communications architecture. Two protocols have been designed to send position and alert messages to/from a centralized server over 4G cellular networks. One of the protocols is implemented using a REST architecture on top of the HTTP protocol, and the other one is implemented over the UDP protocol. We show that the proposed alarm system is feasible regarding communication response time, and we conclude that the application should be implemented over the UDP protocol, as response times are about three times better than for the REST implementation. We tested the applications in real deployments, finding that drivers are warned of the presence of bicycles when closer than 150 m, having enough time to pay attention to the situation and drive more carefully to avoid a collision. © 2021 by the authors.

This study, therefore, aims to investigate the sustainability of cities by using the specific perspective of their relationship with the companies’ urban settlements. Some questions in the present work are discussed: What advantages derive from the firms’ settlements in downtown areas? What is the impact on urban geographies? What role does urban policy play in this process? How do cities perceive this large business settlement? To answer to these questions, a model of dynamic equilibrium, referred to as the public–private relationship, is provided. The analysis starts from the context of the city as a commercial space, then identifies the determinants of the establishment of businesses in the city centers and the mediating function of politics in this urban morphogenesis.

Promoting waste sorting is one of the priorities for various levels of public authorities in the context of the rapid growth of waste generation all around China. To achieve this goal, waste‐sorting policies should be precisely designed to ensure successful waste reduction at all stages. Previous studies have neglected the spillover effects of different regulatory policies, which may affect the overall goal of reducing waste by influencing different waste production stages. This paper fills this gap by comparing the spillover effects of two typical waste‐sorting policies on sustainable consumption behaviours through a survey conducted in Shanghai and Beijing (control group). By combining quasi‐natural experiment and questionnaire methods, this paper analyses data through a mediation test to explore the spillover effects between different regulatory policy groups and the effects of the mediation psychological factors. Results show that a penalty policy significantly decreases people’s sustainable consumption behaviours through a negative spillover effect, while a voluntary participation policy significantly increases sustainable consumption behaviours through a positive spillo-ver effect. Results can provide implications for policymaking in waste management and other pro-environmental fields to help cities become more sustainable by shifting multiple behaviours. © 2021 by the authors.

That is why both for inhabitants and local businesses city logistics issues are particularly important. The need for more sustainable transportation and integrative planning processes in cities, has been widely developed since 2013 when Urban Mobility Package set up a concept for SUMP (Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans) Within this idea, EU provides financial support for urban mobility projects. So various city logistics’ solutions are implemented but with a different level of success. City logistics measures have in fact their weaknesses and strengths. It is rather challenging to find an optimal solution because it is difficult to take into account the complexity and diversity of urban logistics while keeping all sides engaged. City logistics seems to be a quite difficult issue, mostly because it contains several levels of complexity. Not only it refers to the diversity of the goods transported and heterogeneity of the transportation means, but also involves multiple stakeholders. The most important are authorities, transportation operator, retailers and residents. These stakeholders most often represent different aims and priorities. While local authorities are interested in reducing pollution, congestion or noise, transportation operators and retailers are mainly focused on keeping costs under control while maintaining service levels. In the study, in-depth interviews technique with various stakeholders of city logistics was used. The interview was based on a questionnaire consisting of open and closed questions. One scale question assessed the importance of a given dimension of sustainable urban logistics for the particular stakeholder. This approach made it possible to identify the priorities of individual stakeholder groups. The respondents were a few individual stakeholders for each group identified within the literature review. To address the aim of the study, to analyse gathered data, both qualitative and quantitative methods were implemented. Among the qualitative methods, the Delphi method, text analysis and text mining techniques were used to identify the main characteristics of stakeholders opinions. Then, to draw the detailed results for each group, the Kruskal-Wallis test was held, equivalent to ANOVA, but not requiring normal distribution of variables, impossible to achieve at small sizes of stakeholder groups samples. The Kruskal-Wallis test allowed identifying similarities and differences between the priorities of the studied groups in light of the research problem being examined. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"

Following recent studies investigating professional work and moral agency, the article engages with Terence Halliday’s famous distinction between science-based and normative professions. Contrary to this argument, the article argues that the practice of engineers, the clearest example of the so-called ‘science-based’ profession, is fraught with moral questions and practices. By drawing on French pragmatic sociology, the article conceptualizes the different ways engineers and others work in situations of uncertainty as different modes of trying. In these modes, professionals rely on different moral principles and ideas for evaluating and judging the professional solutions. As such, the article contributes to the sociology of professions by suggesting a new analytical frame for analyzing moral work as fundamental to professional practice in situations of uncertainty. Empirically, the article builds on fieldwork observations and interviews with professionals from an ongoing research project on Danish climate adaptation in cities and urban rainwater management.

It is much more than just providing sufficient light intensity with reduced energy consumption and low environmental impact. The solution to this challenge is not only technological, but also requires the consideration of the subjective approach, such as psychological, sociological, and aesthetic-functional. The article presents the SEC (Suitable for everyone, Environmentally-accepted, Cost-effective) methodology and model, which are placed in the context of sustainable city lighting. A holistic assessment approach of user environmental perception, priorities, and spatial responses is required to evaluate the impact of artificial night illumination. Lighting efficiency was expressed as the correspondence between environmental perception and spatial utilization during day and night. Ten sites with different urban background and illumination characteristics were selected. It was assumed that artificial night lighting influences the perception, priorities, and responsiveness of users. The validity of this argument was demonstrated at a relevant statistical level of p < 0.05. The research results provided useful information about the current state, which is needed to prepare a sustainable lighting strategy, and could be compared between different or similar sites. Based on the obtained results, it can be concluded that the artificial lighting of urban open spaces is of high quality when the difference in the spatial perception and spatial utilization between day and night is as small as possible. © 2021 by the authors.

This paper aims to identify and analyse primary studies related to a set of research questions on road network pricing that primarily address the effectiveness of road network pricing as a travel demand management strategy. The paper achieves this by consolidating the frag-mented evidence on the topic and identifying the role of transport pricing in steering our post-pan-demic cities on a path of sustainable urban mobility. The paper uses a reliable and auditable systematic approach to examine past and current research trends, resulting in a rational assessment of the role and impacts of road network pricing as a travel demand management strategy. The paper achieves this by performing a bibliometric citation analysis that identifies 105 articles of valuable research contributions that represent fundamental knowledge in the development of research cov-ering the period between 2007 and 2020. Importantly, the review identifies four main research themes in the literature, namely implementation impacts, innovations in technology, acceptability, and modelling methodologies for determining impacts, that are core elements of the research effort on the travel demand management and sustainability aspects of road pricing. Inductive reasoning is then used to address emerging issues, applications, and the effects of road network pricing in reducing congestion and enhancing urban centre environmental quality. The paper concludes with a discussion of policy directions for overcoming barriers to the implementation of road network pricing as an effective strategy for addressing modern-day urban mobility challenges such as rising urban populations, emissions, and pollution particularly amid and post Covid19. Finally, the paper provides a roadmap of future research opportunities that can heighten the role of road network pricing in shaping the directions of sustainable urban transport policies and strategies. © 2021 by the authors.

Using the Sino-German Eco-Park in Qingdao as a case study, we argue that while multilevel governance and international cooperation are often discussed separately, these two governance tendencies are in fact both important to China's urban climate experimentation. In particular, Chinese multilevel governance enables bilateral cooperation by (re)shaping the national vision at the local level and resolving potential conflicts or contradictions. It also allows local and foreign intermediaries to coordinate and match resources among different interests and actors. The effectiveness of multilevel governance in eco-city projects is conditioned by intermediary institutions’ resources and capabilities. Effectiveness also depends on maintaining the attention of national governments to the eco-city projects. Thus, the cooperative form, the actors’ attributes, and the resources mobilised by actors are three important factors that affect the outcomes of international eco-city projects. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"

The over-consumption of non-renewable resources causes pollution which leads to global warming. Consequently, government agencies have been taking several initiatives to control the over-consumption of non-renewable natural resources and encourage the production of renewable energy resources. In this regard, we introduce an IoT powered integrated framework called as green home architecture (GHA) for green score calculation based on the usage of natural resources for household purpose. Green score is a credit point (i.e.,10 pts) of a family which can be calculated once in a month based on the utilization of energy, production of renewable energy and pollution caused. The green score can be improved by reducing the consumption of energy, generation of renewable energy and preventing the pollution. The main objective of GHA is to monitor the day-to-day usage of resources and calculate the green score using the proposed green score algorithm. This algorithm gives positive credits for economic consumption of resources and production of renewable energy and also it gives negative credits for pollution caused. Here, we recommend a green score based tax calculation system which gives tax exemption based on the green score value. This direct beneficiary model will appreciate and encourage the citizens to consume fewer natural resources and prevent pollution. Rather than simply giving subsidy, this proposed system allows monitoring the subsidy scheme periodically and encourages the proper working system with tax exemption rewards. Also, our GHA will be used to monitor all the household appliances, vehicles, wind mills, electricity meter, water re-treatment plant, pollution level to read the consumption/production in appropriate units by using the suitable sensors. These values will be stored in mass storage platform like cloud for the calculation of green score and also employed for billing purpose by the government agencies. This integrated platform can replace the manual billing and directly benefits the government.  © 2021 KSII."

To achieve this goal, publications and 27 sustainable cities projects were also consulted, through project reports and programs from the cities themselves on the topic were consulted. A text mining analysis was applied to the results obtained in this literature review to find the main factors related to sustainable cities. To evaluate the findings of this first stage, consultations with specialists were carried out, specifically to assess the main factors. Based on the previous steps, and based on the original BSC, an adaptation of the tool was proposed, where its structure was changed to meet the needs of the strategic management of sustainable cities. It was concluded that creating a sustainable city requires understanding the difficulties faced by urban center managers with the implementation and management of institutional sustainable development practices. The BSC for sustainable cities can assist as a viable management strategic tool to more efficient use of resources in order to develop sustainable cities. © 2021 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

Therefore, a short-term planning method for smart traffic signals in an ecological city based on the NS-BML model is proposed. We complete modeling with minimal or existing data, and predict traffic parameters. Based on the established model, we complete the design of vehicle acceleration and deceleration control laws, set open boundary and closed boundary parameter conditions, and optimize the allocation strategy of the short-term traffic signals. The Manhattan network is used to simulate traffic intersections, and the strategy process is designed to complete the research on the short-term planning method of traffic signals. The results of the simulation experiment show that, in the same simulation environment, the proposed method has a significant reduction in the delay time of the trunk line compared with the traditional planning method, and the average number of stoppages on the trunk line is also reduced by 0.87, which verifies that the designed planning method has a certain reliability. © 2021 Parlar Scientific Publications.

In a recent investigation of the global demand for energy consumption across various energy consumption sectors, the building sector has been shown to be one of the primary energy consumers, with a high percentage of energy consumption deemed as unnecessary. This as a result of poor management practice and implementation of strategies to avoid excess energy consumption. Over the years, researchers in both academia and industries have focused on various techniques to deal with unnecessary energy consumption and ensuring a healthy living environment for green smart cities. Among these techniques is Smart Home Energy Management Systems (SHEMs), which transform electric home appliances, sensor nodes, into autonomous devices in order to manage energy consumption effectively. This study presents an analysis of smart home energy management system with the goal to identify current trends and challenges for future improvement. The result reveals lack of quality attributes such as security, privacy, scalability, interoperability, and difficulty in managing and adapt to the thermal comfort satisfaction of residents, exposing them to health risks.

Its aim is to reduce the gap in the literature between sustainable cities and smart cities with respect to urban development guidelines. Moreover, development directions for smart, sustainable, and inclusive urban environmental planning and design strategies are evaluated. To achieve these goals, a static evaluation system was developed and big data technique was used to construct a dynamic model. This model identifies factors that affect sustainable and smart cities and simulates changes in urban built environments under dynamic conditions, such as changes in regional development policies or space structures. Our proposed model is applied to examine the effects of both economic development and environmental issues on urban built environments. Moreover, changes in urban land intensification use mean that this model can be used to identify a set of management strategies that can meet planning targets and yield a sustainable urban built environment. Our proposed model is illustrated through case studies that demonstrate both the state of the art and the state of current practice to planners and decision makers. Our study revealed that the dependency weights of 10 indicators (listed in descending order) were ""public transportation availability""(weights being 0.310), ""prevalence of technology""(0.175), ""greenhouse gas emission""(0.103), ""domestic water use""(0.092), ""living environment quality""(0.082), ""decision making""(0.060), ""innovation and internationalization""(0.050), ""human resource quality""(0.048), ""air pollution and noise""(0.048), and ""government transparency""(0.032).

My country's development situation is relatively uneven. In the more developed areas of my country, the speed of urbanization is relatively rapid, such as cities near the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta. But with the development of urbanization, these areas are also facing a very troublesome problem, that is, the balance between the development of the city and the environmental ecosystem. In order to monitor this situation, we will use remote sensing technology to conduct a comprehensive survey of the urban environmental ecosystem and analyze the impact and effect of the rapid development of the city on the changes in the ecosystem. This article will focus on the area around the Yangtze River Delta, and investigate the spatial patterns of urban environmental ecosystems by comparing this area with cities in developed regions such as Western Europe and North America. Under the conditions of different regions and different degrees of urbanization, the comprehensive situation of environmental elements in the city is investigated, and the environmental impact effects and the causes, effects and effects of environmental changes are more accurately studied. Combine the BP network model related to the nervous system in the experiment, and continuously optimize the model during the experiment. The experimental data selects environmental difference reports displayed in different years and different seasons to predict the air pollution value of a certain city. The reason why we use this method is that this model can improve the accuracy of statistical data and greatly simplify the unnecessary and complicated steps in the research process, and it can also reduce the error problems generated in the operation of the BP system, such as when we When entering a piece of data, the data obtained is often very different from the target data. Therefore, we will use the ant colony algorithm to solve the above problems, and add stereo and 3D technologies, which can monitor experiments in real time, greatly improve the speed of the experiment, and the 3D stereo technology can make the results more perceptual to meet the needs of the experiment. © 2021 Elsevier B.V."

Meanwhile, policymakers and practitioners alike need to pursue progressive development. In response to this shortcoming, this research offers content analysis studies based on topic modeling approaches to capture the evolution and characteristics of topics in the scientific literature on smart and sustainable city research. More importantly, a novel topic-detecting algorithm based on the deep learning and clustering techniques, namely deep autoencoders-based fuzzy C-means (DFCM), is introduced for analyzing the research topic trend. The topics generated by this proposed algorithm have relatively higher coherence values than those generated by previously used topic detection methods, namely non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), and eigenspace-based fuzzy C-means (EFCM). The 30 main topics that appeared in topic modeling with the DFCM algorithm were classified into six groups (technology, energy, environment, transportation, e-governance, and human capital and welfare) that characterize the six dimensions of smart, sustainable city research. © 2021 by the authors.

At the same time, urban sustainability paradigms tend to focus on purely technical solutions to transportation challenges, leaving questions of history and social power aside. Drawing from ethnographic fieldwork in Aguascalientes Mexico, this article contributes to the transportation and mobility justice literature by focusing on the work of social movements in confronting a variety of challenges in the provision of active-transportation services. First, this research explores how social movements express and negotiate transportation-justice concerns to government and planning authorities. Next, I build on the concept of insurgent citizenship to highlight the processes through which residents contest ongoing injustices and formulate alternatives for building inclusive cities. From the creation of makeshift cycling lanes in underserved urban areas to the search for socially just alternative to policing, social movements are forging new pathways to re-envision sustainable transportation systems. These insurgent forms of citymaking—understood here as insurgent mobilities—underscore the creative role of citizens in producing the city as well as the enormous amount of care work involved in these processes. © 2021 by the author.

From the perspective of urban practitioners and other stakeholders, there are two main schools of thought that discuss the roles of informality in the urban development discourse. The first school maintains that informality hinders the urban development process while the other posits that informality could be helpful in the urban sustainability push. In this article, the researchers, focusing on the latter, explores the productive functions of informality in developing sustainable Ghanaian cities. The researchers relied predominantly on secondary data. Using the Boolean search methodology, data were extracted from 85 articles/reports/websites that were obtained from online data and journal publishing repositories such as JSTOR, Scopus, SAGE and Taylor and Francis. The results from the thematic analysis of the data indicate that informality plays a vital role in promoting the economic, environmental, and social sustainability of cities in Ghana. Specifically, the informal economy and informal spaces contribute to the employment of both men and women, household income, tax revenue, waste management, water access, organic farming, health care access, social equity, and innovation. The paper concludes that informality in Ghana could profoundly facilitate the attainment of the sustainable city development objectives. Viewing informality through a productive lens, as we have argued in the paper, calls for a shift from ‘broad blanket and criminalisation’ policies on informality to more inclusive and pro-poor policies. Additionally, understanding the enormous opportunities informality presents to cities in the Global South will lead to increased investment and restructuring to mitigate the barriers its poses to the city development process. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"

Eco-city construction has been implemented in many countries in recent years; however, quantitative research on its economic impact has only started. This study establishes a theoretical model of the impact of eco-city construction on a firm’s research and development (R&D) investment. The numerical simulation results show that eco-city construction promotes a firm’s R&D investment and long-term earnings from two aspects: (1) macro policies increase a firm’s exogenous uncertainty and (2) ecological capital enhances a firm’s business conditions. The empirical study matches the microscopic data of 115 cities and 2612 listed firms in China from 2008 to 2017, and results show that eco-city construction has a significant positive impact on firm innovation input and output. Further research shows that this positive impact mainly comes from ecological environment and ecological economy, and there is regional heterogeneity. For the first time, this study affirms the positive role of eco-city construction from the perspective of firm innovation activities at the micro level. It provides strong evidence for the government to realise the sustainable development of firms by accelerating eco-city construction. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

As cities continue to densify, however, urban green spaces are becoming smaller and more isolated. Many hope that wildflowers, and with them also faunistic biodiversity, can be maintained through networks of small informal green spaces. Currently, there are little data available for city planners to answer the questions of how patch size and ecological connectivity affect the population persistence of wildflowers in small vegetation patches. To address these concerns, we surveyed all vegetation patches greater than 1 m2 in public spaces across seven 1 km2 quadrats distributed across the city of Zurich, Switzerland. Our survey focused on a list of 166 herbaceous vascular plant species. We analyzed vegetation patch topologies (frequency distributions of size and connectivity) and related it to alpha and beta species diversity. Dispersal traits of investigated species were used to interpret connectivity patterns. Over 75 % of patches were <20 m2 in size, however, these small patches made up only 3.4 % of total vegetation area. Species richness was significantly positively correlated with patch area. Nevertheless, taken together, small patches had similar species richness and higher beta diversity than larger patches. These small patches contribute far more than expected to overall wildflower species richness in the city – “punching above their weight”. This held true even for less common species. However, our research indicates that connecting these patches to one another and to larger green spaces is essential to unlocking their potential as habitats and potentially allowing for the natural colonization and reinforcement of existing populations. As cities densify, we must acknowledge that small vegetation patches such as tree discs or road margins are essential for the survival of wildflower populations and associated fauna, especially in highly urbanized areas. © 2021 The Author(s)"

However, academic discussions on rebound effects mostly focus on environmental issues such as the material and energy rebound. Social aspects of rebound effects including radical organizational changes and damage to workers’ and citizens’ health and rights are relatively ignored. From the perspective of sustainable cities, it is necessary to take care of urban stakeholders and consider both environmental and social justice to prevent different dimensions of impact. Accordingly, this paper serves to broaden academic discourses on the circular economy rebound, proposes a framework to align CE with the context of sustainable cities, and clarifies the linkages between rebound effects and different phases of CE. It is concluded that policy makers should not solely emphasize numeric indicators of resource efficiency; instead, they should articulate the social context of rebound effects and address potential impact in advance to ensure sustainability. Via the integration of interdisciplinary knowledge, open information, and moral responsibility, CE stakeholders including relevant industries, governments, and communities can together establish more socially inclusive policies and regulations in a systematic manner for sustainable cities. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd"

In this study, an assessment system has been developed to identify livable, original, and sustainable neighborhoods and to score them. This assessment system is in the process of developing and complying with the global assessment systems examined both in Turkey and the specific assessment criteria established on the basis of different approaches. The assessment system developed was automated with the GIS interface, ensuring that the process continued effectively. The GIS interface generated allows rapid analysis of the assessment and rating processes of livable cities.

The focus on potential of microalgae in contributing to the development of green cities is rising. The advantage of microalgae is their ability to gather energy from sunlight and carbon dioxide, followed by transforming the nutrients into biomass and oxygen. This leads to the creation of green cities through algae cultivation as waste and renewable materials can be put to good use. The challenges that arise when using algae and the future prospect in terms of SDGs and economy will also be covered in this review. The future of green cities can be enhanced with the adaptation of algae as the source of renewable plants to create a better outlook of an algae green city. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd"

The implementation of legal acts and diverse environmentally oriented sectoral policies plays an important role in that process. The objective of this paper is to determine the antecedences and effects of the transformation of cities in accordance with the eco-city concept in Poland in the context of implemented policies, legislation and initiatives. The study reviews the normative acts and programme-strategic documents that provide the framework for the shift towards eco-city at the international and EU level, as well as identifying changes in legislation and policy initiatives resulting from their implementation at national and local level. A set of 24 original indices referring to six aspects of the eco-city (waste management, water and wastewater management, transport and urban mobility, application of RES in energy engineering, air quality, and urban green areas) were applied in multi-criterion analyses in selected case studies. This permitted us to identify the key factors that power the transition towards eco-city. The legal and policy measures are implemented in a top-down approach. Actions are usually initiated at national level and implemented by local authorities, who operate according to their assigned tasks and using dedicated tools (e.g. LEPs, SUMPs). Significant effect of the implementation of eco-city solutions were identified in waste management, sustainable transport, urban mobility, and air quality improvement. Recommendations for future measures include implementing plans and demonstrative projects of eco-cities or eco-districts, conducting complex pro-ecological measures, and increasing the role of bottom-up actions.  © 2021 Dagmara Kociuba et al., published by Sciendo."
"A novel urban overall spatial planning method based on matter element model using in eco-city construction","2021","","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85101362166&partnerID=40&md5=a679540cdfd0aaab96ed4a6e76f9bf41","The current planning methods fail to integrate the ecological and environmental problems into the overall urban spatial planning, which easily leads to the decrease of urban overall space utilization rate and the increase of planning cost. Therefore, a new urban overall space planning method based on the matter-element model was proposed. Combined with the socio-economic and ecological conditions of the study area, the ""pressure-response"" model was used to establish the evaluation index system, and the planning and implementation plan and plan formulation process were organically combined. The ecological environment factors are fully integrated into the urban overall space planning, and the ecological environment impact of the urban overall space planning is evaluated by combining the analytic hierarchy process and matter-element model, and the best urban overall space planning scheme is obtained through the evaluation results. The simulation results show that the proposed method can effectively improve the overall space utilization of the city, and the planning cost is low, which proves that the proposed method has strong application advantages and good application prospects. © by PSP"

Nowadays, the demand for fresh, healthy, locally and sustainably produced food in German urban areas is constantly increasing. At the same time, current agricultural systems contribute significantly to exceeding the planetary boundaries. The disruption of the phosphorus and nitrogen cycles in particular stands out from the manifold effects of modern food production on the Earth system. One central issue that will have to be faced in the future is how increased yields in agriculture will be achieved with high-energy requirements in fertilizer production and pollution of water and soil by phosphorus and reactive nitrogen. City region food systems (CRFS) can be a solution to overcome these issues. Nevertheless, to ensure sustainable CRFS, innovative technologies and methods need to be developed, including nutrient and energy recovery and adapted horticultural cultivation methods that fit complex urban dynamics. Such new strategies need to be integrated in long-term social and political transformation processes to enhance acceptance of food produced by recyclates. The joint contribution of experts from the wastewater, horticultural, and political sciences, together with industrial and societal sector actors, is critical to reach these objectives. The overarching goal of SUSKULT’s vision is the establishment of the field of urban circular agricultural production as an innovative sector of the bio-based economy in Germany. © 2021 by the authors.

However, in most of the wastewater treatment plants that produce biogas through sludge digestion, there is no thermal energy recovery or electricity generation, and the biogas is flared and wasted, particularly in developing countries. This paper discusses the recent technological advances related to biogas recovery from wastewater treatment besides identifying research gaps and local conditions, which affect implementation. Techniques for enhancement of biogas production such as co-digestion and microalgae systems for energy recovery were reviewed in terms of performance and context for application. This paper provides an assessment of how local conditions promote or hinder biogas recovery from WWTP in megacities of developing countries. The lack of government subsidies and a biogas market that is not well developed and regulated hinder biogas recovery implementation in the studied megacities. Infrastructure and electricity prices are also discussed. Strategies to promote energy recovery are recommended based on successful examples of energy self-sufficient WWTP. The findings may not only support planning on energy recovery but also guide technological development and research on this topic, aligned with the sustainable development goals. © 2021 The Authors"

This paper discusses the role of industrial agglomeration on urban pollution amelioration (haze pollution) using a sample of 253 prefecture-level cities in China. The highlight of this paper is the study of economic and environmental factors in the development of sustainable cities in the same framework and a series of econometric treatments that greatly increase the accuracy of the empirical evidence. Research intuitively shows that China’s haze pollution is clustered in spatial distribution and is spatially heterogeneous in concentration. With the passage of time, haze pollution has a tendency to move from an H–H concentration area to an L–L concentration area. The regression results show that an increase in the scale of local industrial agglomeration will lead to a decrease in local haze pollution; but an increase in the scale of local industrial agglomeration will lead to an increase in haze pollution in adjacent areas. Industrial agglomeration has significant spatial spillover effects, which are spatially heterogeneous. In addition, spillover effects between regions are greater than those within regions. After replacing the spatial weight matrix and controlling the endogenous problem using the instrumental variable method, the conclusion is still robust. © 2021 by the authors.

The paper examines (i) the nature and patterns of residential segregation of ethnic minorities, (ii) the factors and processes underlying the locational choice of ethnic minorities, and (iii) the knowledge or perception on dimensions and effects of ethnic residential segregation on sustainable city development. This paper uses two migrant communities – Aboabo and Asawase – in Kumasi, Ghana's fastest growing city as case studies. The study adopts household surveys, focus group discussions, secondary data and agency interviews to achieve the objectives of the research. Findings of the paper generally show that even in highly dense populated and multi-ethnic neighbourhoods, some levels of clustering are possible for several reasons. The existence of migrant communities has both positive and adverse implications on environmental, social and economic sustainability of the city. There is however no urban planning or management regime in place to harness the potentials of such neighbourhoods for sustainable city development. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"

As the global community seeks to contend with even hotter weather in the future as a consequence of global climate change, there is a pressing need to better understand the most effective prevention and response measures that can be implemented, particularly in low-resource settings. In this Series paper, we describe how a future reliance on air conditioning is unsustainable and further marginalises the communities most vulnerable to the heat. We then show that a more holistic understanding of the thermal environment at the landscape and urban, building, and individual scales supports the identification of numerous sustainable opportunities to keep people cooler. We summarise the benefits (eg, effectiveness) and limitations of each identified cooling strategy, and recommend optimal interventions for settings such as aged care homes, slums, workplaces, mass gatherings, refugee camps, and playing sport. The integration of this information into well communicated heat action plans with robust surveillance and monitoring is essential for reducing the adverse health consequences of current and future extreme heat. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"

Beijing-Hebei-Tianjin (BTH) urban agglomeration, for example, experiences severe water shortages due to rapidly expanding urban populations, industrial use, and irrigation-intensive agriculture. Climate change has further threatened water resources security. Overuse of water resources to meet the demand of various water sectors has far-reaching health and environmental implications including ecosystem sustainability. Surface water and groundwater pollution present public health risks. Despite the extraordinary policies and efforts being made and implemented by the Government of China, the BTH region currently lacks coordination among stakeholders leading to poor water governance. Consultation among scientists, engineers and stakeholders on regional water security issues is crucial and must be frequent and inclusive. An international symposium was held in Shijiazhuang in early November 2019 to identify some of the key water security challenges and scope of an idealized future eco-city in the region by developing a sustainability framework. This work drew on experiences from across China and beyond. Scientists agree that integration of science, technology, and governance within an appropriate policy framework was particularly significant for combating the issue of water insecurity, including in the region's newly developed city, Xiong'an New Area. An emerging concept, “Healthy Waterways and Ecologically Sustainable Cities” which integrates social, ecological and hydrological systems and acts as an important pathway for sustainability in the 21st century was proposed in the symposium to tackle the problems in the region. This high level biophysical and cultural concept empowers development goals and promotes human health and wellbeing. The framework on healthy waterways and ecologically sustainable cities can overcome sustainability challenges by resolving water resource management issues in BTH in a holistic way. To implement the concept, we strongly recommend the utilization of evidence-based scientific research and institutional cooperation including national and international collaborations to achieve the Healthy Waterways and Ecologically Sustainable Cities goal in the BTH in future.

The problem appears to be critical in urban areas where manmade structures sig-nificantly alter the temperature balance, thus highlighting the importance of sustainable management and proper inventory of urban green zones. Based on this, the paper provides a case study on using a combination of open-access and low-cost urban greenery inventory methods that could be used by municipal governments and private land managers to estimate the contribution of urban trees to the mitigation of urban heat impacts. The research focuses on the urban greenery inventory of courtyards in high-rise residential districts of the city of Kyiv (Ukraine), aiming to estimate the adapting potential of urban vegetation against heatwaves. Visual and thermal satellite images of Kyiv enabled us to estimate how the density of buildings and greenery is distributed and analyze the surface temperature in residential districts. A UAV thermal imaging survey was made in four selected locations with varying vegetation coverage, followed by leaf-based field instrumental analysis of photosynthetic activity in selected city tree species at hot temperatures. In addition, 16 port-able temperature and humidity sensors were installed in shaded and sunlight-exposed areas of the locations in focus to assess the microclimate formation impact of trees in a high-rise residential courtyard.

To promote its development, the evaluation and tracking of its sustainability have become significant in academic exploration. However, few efforts have been made in this regard. Thus, this paper aims to fill this gap by choosing Rizhao city, a coastal CEE, as a case study and employing an emergy-based method to assess its sustainability from 2005 to 2017. The study results show that the socio-economic development depends on the utilization of local non-renewable resources. Moreover, the self-support ratio was found to be above 94 %, which, in turn, led to an increase in the environmental loading ratio. However, due to a rise in resource recycle ratio, the emergy sustainability index and sustainable development index first showed a decreasing trend and then an increasing one. Consequently, the performance of the circular economy has improved, especially in terms of resolving the dilemma between a superior environment and a backward economy. Nevertheless, the coordinated development within the system was not adequate.

As the Eco-cities entering operation stage gradually, more and more researchers have found that users (who are living or working in the Eco-cities) satisfaction is one of the most important factors to determine the success or failure of Eco-cities. Therefore, it is very important to investigate the user demands to attract more citizens willing to live or work in the Eco-cities, which will make the development of Eco-cities more sustainable and solid. The recent researches on user demands investigation and analysis in the Eco-cities mainly focused on understanding the user need itself, yet lack of research on the relationship between the user demand and user satisfaction. This paper initially introduced the Kano model analysis method to the research field of user demands in Eco-city, to explore the relationship between the user demand and user satisfaction. After proposing user demands library in Eco-city (including Land use, Ecological environment, Green building, Energy utilization, etc.), the user demands classification and importance analysis methods of Eco-city were proposed based on Kano model. The questionnaire survey for users of two Eco-cities in China as case study was conducted, consisted of user demand items questionnaire based on the Kano model and a questionnaire on the importance of the user demand items. By utilizing the integration of quantitative analysis methods based on the Kano model and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method, the final ranking of user demands importance was obtained. Comparing with the existing literatures in terms of user demands research for Eco-city, the user demands analysis method based on Kano model of this paper, is able to reveal the influence degree of user satisfaction towards the facilities and services provided in the Eco-city. The user demands analysis method can be used for other researchers worldwide to investigate and quantitively analyze user demands according to their local development situation and preference of Eco-city. The user demands analysis results obtained through this method, can benefit different stages of Eco-city. © 2021 Public Library of Science. All rights reserved."

"Constructing urban sprawl measurement system of the Yangtze River economic belt zone for healthier lives and social changes in sustainable cities","2021","10.1016/j.techfore.2021.120569","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099369706&doi=10.1016%2fj.techfore.2021.120569&partnerID=40&md5=909cb046368293468b4399b89758a21a","This study was carried out for the purpose of practicing the concept of green, healthy and sustainable urban development, and building a healthy and effective regional economy. The urban sprawl theory is the theoretical foundation in this study. Creatively, deep learning and neural networks were combined to propose an algorithm. Afterwards, a theoretical model of urban sprawl growth was built, with urban industrial development as the principal indicator. According to cities’ economic data in the Yangtze River Economic Belt from 2005 to 2019, the model was optimized through data learning to obtain the final measurement system. On this basis, the urban sprawl levels in different regions could be analyzed. Results demonstrate that the model using the FEPA (Financial Time Series - Empirical Mode Decomposition - Principal Component Analysis - Artificial Neural Network) fusion algorithm has higher errors than other models, with an average accuracy of 82.61% and a total evaluation score of 0.778. Compared with the latest urban sprawl analysis models, the proposed model improves the performance by 7.9%, and keeps the hit rate above 70%, which is suitable for the urban sprawl measurement. In addition, the urban spatial pattern of the Yangtze River Economic Belt is always greater than 1, and the entire space is relatively narrow. From 2005 to 2019, the region's urban sprawl degree has increased by more than 50%. In general, the proposed model can well indicate the urban sprawl situation, so it has a significant reference value for research on the urban sprawl measurement system. © 2021 Elsevier Inc."

For this research, we planned and conducted empirical studies to examine the areas influencing the quality of life from the point of view of municipalities. A questionnaire form was developed and a survey was conducted on a sample of 84 municipal offices in Poland. We tabulated, statistically processed and analysed the results and thoroughly investigated the areas influencing the quality of life, their impact and importance. We determined which areas of the city are included in municipal research and checked whether there was a need to expand these areas. We found that the people responsible for research in municipal offices are aware that the quality of life is influenced by many areas and conditions. However, these people only choose selected areas for research and have a problem with indicating what can be extended to them.

The South-East Mediterranean (SEM) area risks becoming even more vulnerable, due both to the impacts of climate change and to the uncontrolled urbanization process and degradation of natural resources. The experimental strategies used by countries with a higher level of wealth to implement development models of more sustainable urban areas often include use of information and communication technologies (ICTs), thus pursuing a Smart City approach. This paper analyzes the strategies promoted by international organizations to address some of the most pressing problems in the Mediterranean. It also attempts to delve into the role ICTs play in these programs. The results show that those projects that embrace this direction are still rather limited. This is mostly due to the necessity, for most SEM countries, to tackle the problem of strengthening networks and accessing information. The next European investments are moving in this direction, but support for local governments in defining a critical approach toward ""a Mediterranean way toward the Smart City""is crucial.  © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers."

Therefore, there is a need to compare these efforts using evaluation frameworks. According to the literature review, the basic dimensions of smart cities are generally evaluated with the criteria of regional competitiveness, transportation, information and communication technology, economy, natural resources, human and social capital, quality of life and participation of citizens in the management of cities. In this paper, Analytical Network Process (ANP) is used to weight smart and sustainable city criteria. According to the results, while 'smart living' is the most important characteristic with a 35,459% priority, 'smart governance' is the last with 5,738%. The study covers 44 cities around the world and comparisons were made by TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution). According to the results, Tokyo, London and New York are in the top three in the overall ranking. But none of these cities is among the top five in terms of smart governance, mobility and environmental dimensions.

In general, it can be defined as the integration of IoT and Information Communication Technologies (ICT) into city management, with the aim of addressing the exponential growth of urbanization and population, thus significantly increasing people’s quality of life. The smart city paradigm is also strictly connected to sustainability aspects, taking into account, for example, the reduction of environmental impact of urban activities, the optimized management of energy resources, and the design of innovative services and solution for citizens. Abiding by this new paradigm, several cities started a process of strong innovation in different fields (such as mobility and transportation, industry, health, tourism, and education), thanks to significant investments provided by stakeholders and the European Commission (EC). In this paper, we analyze key aspects of an IoT infrastructure for smart cities, outlining the innovations implemented in the city of Parma (Emilia Romagna region, Italy) as a successful example.

However, as supporting facilities of electric vehicles, public charging stations are of great significance to the promotion of electric vehicles. This paper proposes an electric vehicle charging station location model to improve the resource utilization of electric vehicles for sustainable cities. In this model, reservation services, idle rates during off-peak periods, and waiting time during peak periods are considered. Finally, a case from Chengdu, China, is used to examine the effectiveness of the proposed model. Then, further analyses of reservation ratios and penetration rates are conducted. The results show that the introduction of a reservation service has a positive effect on reducing the total cost, which would provide further support for sustainable cities and have an even greater impact on healthier lives. © 2020 by the authors.

Indeed the SDGs recognize the importance of partnerships in solid waste management (SWM) as a way of developing workable and reliable waste management systems. SWM in Nairobi city continues to be a great challenge, and poor practices threaten environmental and public health. Ineffective waste management in Nairobi city has been linked to inefficient policy implementation and enforcement by different stakeholders. To effectively address the challenge of sustainable waste management in Nairobi city, amalgamation of strategies amongst several segments, including stakeholders, private and public sectors (formal and informal), non-governmental organizations and communities, is important, through partnerships to implement improved policies, in terms of capacity, financial prudence, and technical and institutional factors. The paper seeks to analyse existing policy framework on SWM and its effectiveness in addressing SWM in Nairobi city. The study is based on a descriptive research design which involved interrogating the stakeholders included in the implementation of the policy frameworks in place. Data were acquired through semi-structured questionnaires administered to 385 respondents and interviews with 10 key informants. The theoretical framework is based on institutional theory and capacity building theories that expound the gaps in policy implementation and the role of partnerships.

The rapid pace of expansion and development in urban areas will undoubtedly affect many aspects of sustainable development. Unsustainable consumption of natural resources, water, land and recreational facilities will have detrimental effects on the environment as well as on both economic and social health livelihood. Much less attention is being paid to natures that are close to where people live and work, to small-scale green areas in cities and its benefits to people. Increasing empirical evidence, however, indicates that the presence of natural areas contributes to the quality of life in many ways. Besides many environmental and ecological services, urban nature provides important social and psychological benefits to human societies, which enrich human life with meanings and emotions. Thus, this paper elaborates on the general perspectives of the current status of urban forests and green areas in Taman Tasik Seremban, Negeri Sembilan. The issues investigated concerns people's motives for urban nature, the emotional dimension involved in their experience of nature and its importance of its people's general well-being.

The pace of mitigating climate change through an energy transition to renewables is slow, global mean temperature is increasing and sea level seems to rise at an accelerated pace. This puts many livelihoods at risk and communities have to face an uncertain future. Therefore, continuing the way contemporary cities are developing and developed is not an option. The new normal should also be reflected in urbanism. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, the answer to this question is sought in understanding traditional attitudes to living and their relation to the land. How these cultures have been capable of coping with disruptions lies in the way their mental paradigm respects their environment. A more resilient future can be achieved when the traditional values of the relation of societies with the land they live on are considered important and indigenous knowledge and perspectives are used to design cities. Findings: Current society seems to have forgotten what it means and how to put into practice sharing resources and space, giving back more to the environment than used to live. Also, mankind seems to be lacking the ability to move and search for the potentials where to live. Furthermore, choosing to live in safe places, hence being less vulnerable for disruptions, is a principle that has long been neglected. These characteristics of traditional cultures are translated in four principles that are valuable in design processes: first, making use of the energy and power a disaster might bring and turning it into an advantage; second, using imagination to anticipate an unknown future; third, accommodating all paces of urban change; and fourth, designing redundancy for flexibility. The use of these principles is illustrated in three Sydney-based examples.

While operational definitions and the actual planning of these cities can vary considerably (e.g., eco cities and low carbon cities), conceptually, at least, these terms overlap, particularly with regard to how they attempt to achieve both greener infrastructural design and healthier human lifestyles. This paper presents the findings of survey-based research carried out within Lingang New Town in Shanghai in 2019. In the cities of the Global North, the interplay between green infrastructural provision and public health has been of interest, especially in the context of social inequalities; however, there is little research from rapidly urbanizing countries where green urbanism is being increasingly promoted. Using this newly constructed example, we identified a clear positive correlation between moving to a green city and the adoption of healthier lifestyles. The structural equation modelling results suggest that behaviors around the use of green space as well as perceptions of different green space have notable impacts on residents’ physical health, measured by body mass index (BMI). The findings further illustrate systemic inequalities among private housing, rental housing and public housing typologies with regard to the distribution of health benefits. © 2020 by the authors.

One of the ways to protect people from this hazard is the use of urban green or street greenery. However, its implementation can be problematic in highly urbanized areas. This paper presents a concept of the green structure (GS), designed, and is still being developed, by Adam Kalinowski where cooling efficiency is based on the synergy of shade and evapotranspiration. The GS that could be used as street furniture, small architecture form or a public utility structure intended to protect people and objects from an adverse urban environment, at the same time providing pleasant and healthy microclimate inside. The pilot project-the first application of the GS in the urban environment-is presented and the results of short-term measurements of temperature and humidity are provided and analyzed. Moreover, a simple dynamic simulation of the GS performance in courtyards has been conducted. The obtained results show the decrease of the perceived temperature within this structure. Depending on climate type, an average potential reduction of Universal Thermal Comfort Index (UTCI) and mean radiant temperature (Tmrt), caused by the GS in a courtyard case study, is 5-8 °C and 17-29 °C, respectively. Performed simulation also confirms that TRNSYS software is an appropriate tool for simple outdoor microclimate analysis.

Accordingly, the objective of the current study is twofold: in the first instance, we would like to prove the existence of a causal link between the level of smart orientation in a city and the spread of start-ups, namely, the smarter the city, the bigger the number of start-ups, and vice versa by choosing as our case study, a city from the North-Western development region of Romania, Oradea; secondly, we stress, that the promotion of a collaborative governance model by the city leadership, involving all the stakeholders in the decision-making process enables smart orientation within a city. © 2021, Czech Association for European Studies.

Urban floriculture can be a more sustainable and socially acceptable alternative to urban food production as the latter is exposed to high levels of urban generated contaminants. Urban floriculture may also decrease the carbon footprint associated with transportation of fresh cut flowers and provide better quality seasonal product. In this article, we investigate the concept of urban floriculture as an innovative approach for mitigating the negative impacts of global floriculture supply chains. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."
"Procedural environmental injustice in 'Europe's Greenest City': A case study into the felling of sheffield's street trees","2020","10.3390/SOCSCI9060100","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088837142&doi=10.3390%2fSOCSCI9060100&partnerID=40&md5=e46c81040b52d8c731f9d5ba6a3d4a05","With around two million trees within its boundaries, the city of Sheffield, England, is known as the 'greenest city in Europe'. Of these, 36,000 are 'street trees', defined as those planted on pavements and other public rights of way. As of 2012, however, a private contractor was awarded a £2.2 billion contract by Sheffield City Council to upgrade the city's roads over a 25-year period. This required the felling of over 6000 street trees by the end of August 2017. By 2015, this had sparked such widespread public opposition that the felling programme missed its 2017 deadline. For protesters, the central point of contention was and continues to be the seemingly indiscriminate felling of healthy trees. This article examines the specific forms of harm precipitating local public involvement in such opposition. In doing so, it explains the substantive injustices associated with the felling of street trees before focusing on the underpinning forms of procedural environmental injustice that have allowed for their ongoing production. This contributes to wider green criminological literature by demonstrating how public participation in decision-making is crucial for the attainment of environmental justice. © 2020 by the author."
"Evaluation of the potential of classic and electric bicycle commuting as an impetus for the transition towards environmentally sustainable cities: A case study of the university campuses in Liege, Belgium","2020","10.1016/j.rser.2019.109544","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074763342&doi=10.1016%2fj.rser.2019.109544&partnerID=40&md5=5e9830a1bbaa24d56a31cf7ccc07019f","To address the negative effects of car use, conventional and electric bicycles are often proposed as environment-friendly alternatives. The aim of this research is to identify the prospects of a modal shift towards conventional and electric bicycles based on a case study analysing the mobility generated by the three main campuses of the University of Liège in Belgium. In the theoretical part of this paper, the known factors and strategies that affect most of the bicycle use in Europe are summarised and the need for a deeper understanding of the elements that promote a modal shift from bus and car users to the use of electric bicycles is highlighted. Consequently, the results of a survey conducted among the university population of the University of Liège(students, PhD students, and staff members; including 1496 questionnaire responses)are presented and analysed in detail. The Net Promoter Score (NPS), as an indicator of the user satisfaction, confirms that the bicycle has the best NPS compared with the main modes of transport (car and bus) and that the electric bicyclehas a greater NPS than the conventional bicycle. The importance of many factors affecting the use of cycling is lower if we consider the electric bicycleinstead of the conventional bicycle. Considering the current travel patterns in terms of the distances travelled, the potential for the use of conventional bicycles only reaches 23% of the university users, whereas that of electric bicycles reaches 70%. In the pursuit of a modal report, the most imminent factor is the development of safe bike paths, where a potential increase in the bicycle use is acknowledged by 74% of the students, 62% of the staff members, 62% of the car users, and 82% of the bus users. Finally, because the lack of safe cycle lanes remains the major obstacle with respect to the use of both bicycle types, the development and/or improvement of a comfortable and secure infrastructure for cyclists within a radius of 12 km from the main school and work places, especially in the main residential and commercial areas, should be prioritised to promote the use of both types of bicycles. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd"

To do this, the article first surveys smart city literature and the standardization of ‘smartness’ metrics, with particular interest in the International Standards Organization’s (ISO) categorization efforts. It then proposes a northern framework of measurement to evaluate smart cities that adjusts smart metrics from current non-Arctic scholarship to the relatively low populations, peripheral development, remote locations, and harsh climate conditions of the circumpolar north. To test this argument of a new smart framework, the article moves to examine the strategies of three circumpolar cities at different points of smart development: Anchorage (United States), Bodø (Norway) and Oulu (Finland). The article concludes by identifying areas of success and shortcomings for each city analyzed. Smart cities can be a crucial step towards a sustainable future in the circumpolar north, contributing to a ‘smarter’ approach to economic, social, and environmental development. Exploring this is important because these frameworks have implications for how policymakers in northern regions choose to plan and implement their city strategies. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

Today, various AI applications are being used in areas ranging from marketing to banking and finance, from agriculture to healthcare and security, from space exploration to robotics and transport, and from chatbots to artificial creativity and manufacturing. More recently, AI applications have also started to become an integral part of many urban services. Urban artificial intelligences manage the transport systems of cities, run restaurants and shops where every day urbanity is expressed, repair urban infrastructure, and govern multiple urban domains such as traffic, air quality monitoring, garbage collection, and energy. In the age of uncertainty and complexity that is upon us, the increasing adoption of AI is expected to continue, and so its impact on the sustainability of our cities. This viewpoint explores and questions the sustainability of AI from the lens of smart and sustainable cities, and generates insights into emerging urban artificial intelligences and the potential symbiosis between AI and a smart and sustainable urbanism. In terms of methodology, this viewpoint deploys a thorough review of the current status of AI and smart and sustainable cities literature, research, developments, trends, and applications. In so doing, it contributes to existing academic debates in the fields of smart and sustainable cities and AI. In addition, by shedding light on the uptake of AI in cities, the viewpoint seeks to help urban policymakers, planners, and citizens make informed decisions about a sustainable adoption of AI. © 2020 by the authors.

The use of smart technologies such as solar panels or cool roofs helps to reach energy and climate targets. This work presents a flexible methodology based on the use of geographical information systems that allow evaluating the potential use of roofs in a densely built-up context, estimating the roof areas that can be renovated or used to produce renewable energy. The methodology was applied to the case study of the city of Turin in Italy, a 3D roof model was designed, some scenarios were investigated, and priorities of interventions were established, taking into account the conditions of the urban landscape. The applicability of smart solutions was conducted as a support to the review of the Building Annex Energy Code of Turin, within the project ‘Re-Coding’, which aimed to update the current building code of the city. In addition, environmental, economic, and social impacts were assessed to identify the more effective energy efficiency measures. In the Turin context, using an insulated green roof, there was energy saving in consumption for heating up to 88 kWh/m2 /year and for cooling of 10 kWh/m2 /year, with a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 193 tCO2eq /MWh/year and 14 tCO2eq /MWh/year, respectively. This approach could be a significant support in the identification and promotion of energy efficiency solutions to exploit also renewable energy resources with low greenhouse gas emissions. © 2020 by the authors.

Better governance for tackling such complex problems, including policy change and innovation adoption, will require purposeful collaboration. This is particularly evident in projects that involve integration across scales. Our case-study research compared six waterrelated innovations in large cities in Australia, the Netherlands, and the US. We found that government agencies, water utilities, professional organisations, and industry innovators were all vital actors, along with supportive community education. In the initiation phase of innovation, informal networks were used by sustainable innovation champions to galvanise support. As pilot projects emerged, more formal supportive processes and financial incentives were crucial. For large projects and for the mainstreaming of pilot projects, the role of formal coordination and integration mechanisms became vital for coherent and successful implementation. Various forms of networkbased collaborative work were utilised, but the designation of a key coordinating organisation was found to be helpful in maintaining focus and momentum. Coordination activities across organisations, scales, and time were enhanced by the strength of core values and culture, such as valuing stakeholder engagement, innovation, flexibility, and having a focus on outcomes. Overall, this research demonstrated the need to continually evaluate the innovation process to ensure that key ingredients (suitable for each context) are implemented in a timely manner to strengthen the process and enable effective and purposeful collaboration. © 2020 by the authors."

In this context, smart and sustainable cities are those that apply technology and innovation to improve the quality of life of their citizens and the efficiency of services, aiming at sustainable urban development. In practice, however, several challenges are posed to cities that seek to become smart and sustainable. To bring together the intelligence and sustainability dimensions, cities need locally-designed solutions, as well as integrated and balanced strategic urban planning. A strategic framework that can respond to these requirements is Knowledge-Based Urban Development (KBUD), which articulates four knowledge-based development domains (economic, social, spatial and institutional) for a long-term process of urban transformation, in the context of the new knowledge economy and global competitiveness. Methodology: Through a literature review, this article aims to present and discuss the main conceptual and application aspects of KBUD as a strategic approach to the promotion of smart and sustainable cities. Results and discussion: The results indicate that KBUD can contribute by offering a multidimensional and integrated approach to strategic urban planning that includes the implementation of urban technologies, developed by endogenous innovation processes, for a truly smart and sustainable urban development. © 2020 Universidade Nove de Julho-UNINOVE.

To evaluate environmental SDGs, single environmental indicators have been analyzed at national or large regional scale in some literature, while the urban integrated environment is ignored. Therefore, it is necessary to systematically and quantically evaluate the sustainability of ecological environment integrating the water, soil, and air environment at the urban scale. This study aims to construct the Integrated Perception Ecological Environment Indicator (IPEEI) based on the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework to solve the above-mentioned problems. The IPEEI model was proposed based on the three-level association mechanism of the Domain-Theme-Element, and the DPSIR framework conforming to the relevant standards for indicator determination. Moreover, the multi-dimensional, multi-thematic, and multi-urban quantitative evaluations were conducted using the entropy weight method, and the comprehensive evaluation grades by the Jenks natural breaks classification method of the geospatial analysis. Nine cities in the Wuhan Metropolitan Area were selected as the experimental areas. The results were consistent with the Ecological Index and local government's planning and measures, which demonstrated that IPEEI can be effectively verified and applied for the evaluation of urban ecological environment sustainability. © 2020 by the authors."

Poor RNP can lead to traffic congestion, which can lead to higher transportation costs, more pollution and health issues regarding the urban population. To evaluate the effects of the RNP, the involved stakeholders need a real-world data base to work with. This paper develops a data collection approach to enable location-based RNP analysis using publicly available traffic information. Therefore, we use reachable range requests implemented by navigation service providers to retrieve travel times, travel speeds, and traffic conditions. To demonstrate the practicability of the proposed methodology, a comparison of four German cities is made, considering the network characteristics with respect to detours, infrastructure, and traffic congestion. The results are combined with cost rates to compare the economical dimension of sustainability of the chosen cities. Our results show that digitization eases the assessment of traffic data and that a combination of several indicators must be considered depending on the relevant sustainability dimension decisions are made from. © 2020 by the authors."

To answer these questions, this study develops a framework and multidimensional indexes to better explain the different domains of the SSC and their impact on the knowledge-based economy. The analysis was performed on a sample of 116 Italian cities. Italy was chosen because smart city policies are diffused nationwide and Italian urban development is very differentiated (large and small cities; northern and southern cities). The results confirm that the knowledge-based economy at city level is positively correlated to the creation of a urban smart sustainable environment. Moreover, sustainable social services and sustainable local transport are considered the most relevant components of SSC. Our study contributes significantly to the literature by providing a new approach to understanding the factors influencing the creation of an SSC and identifying which SSC domains are important for the development of urban-level economic growth, suitable not only. Its findings, therefore, have implications for academics and urban policy makers, especially for the valorisation of smaller cities. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V."

The trend has shifted from considering technology as a support service towards making it the means for transforming all complex systems. Smart cities focus their development on the use of technology to transform every aspect of society and embrace the complexity of these transformations towards something leading to the well-being and safety of people inhabiting these cities. Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) is an essential aspect to be considered in the design of a smart city and its digital ecosystems, however, it remains unconsidered in most smart city's frameworks, despite the need for a specific space for smart OHS. This paper summarizes a 9-month process of generation of a value proposition for evolving the sector of OHS based on a value-map in whose creation several stakeholders have participated. They focused on identifying the products, the methods, the organizational structures and the technologies required to develop an updated, dynamic and robust prevention model focused on workers in smart and complex contexts, and to improve the organizations' capability to guarantee safety even in the most changing, digital and disruptive settings. To assess the relevance and validity of this value-map, a study was carried out to match the set of its elements and its specific and conceptual products discovered, considering also the definition of the past needs and future trends of the sector that a set of renowned stakeholders and key opinion leaders (with mastery in OHS from several companies and industries) have recently defined for the decade of 2020. A prospective analysis of this match is presented, revealing that there is still an existing gap to be covered in the context of smart cities design: the explicit guarantee of safety for workers.  ©2021 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press."

The software cloning is a severe threat which may breach the security and privacy of android applications. A centrally controlled and automated screening system across multiple app stores is inevitable to prevent the release of copyrighted or cloned copies of these apps. In this paper, we proposed IoT-enabled green city architecture for clone detection in android markets using a deep learning approach. First, the proposed system obtained an original APK file together with potential candidate cloned APKs via the cloud network. For each subject software, the system uses an APK Extractor tool to retrieve Dalvik Executable (DEX) files. The Jdex decompiler is utilized to retrieve Java source files through Dalvik Executables. Second, the AST features are extracted using ANother Tool for Language Recognition (ANTLR) parser. Third, the linear features are mined from these hierarchical structures, and Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF) is applied to estimate the significance of each feature. Finally, the deep learning model is configured to detect cloned apps. The deep learning model is fine-tuned to get better accuracy. The proposed approach is analyzed on five different cloned applications collected from different android markets. The main objective of this system is to avoid the release of pirated apps with various pirated labels in multiple app markets. © 2020 Elsevier B.V."

This paper aims to focus on harmonizing smart and sustainable city initiatives with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals using a systems thinking approach. The study develops conceptual models that support the city transition into being a sustainable smart city. These conceptual models were designed based on the fundamentals of system thinking for a system of several elements under the key catalyzers “Policy and Governance,” “Research & Development,” and “Partnership.” The causalities and interrelationships among elements in developed conceptual models justify the dynamicity and the impact of these elements within a system. The outcome of this research paper would support industry experts, policymakers, and city planners to adopt robust policy interventions and best practices for developing strategies that support the transition of smart cities to the futuristic label of sustainable cities. © 2020 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

Risk file. This mission can only be achieved under conscious leadership based on an advanced strategy that supports the culture of innovation and new practices, managed by leaders capable of making investment decisions for the city. According to previous literature and hundreds of research studies to study this phenomenon in accelerated areas of life, the new technological development has not been comprehensively kept pace with the building of a smart city based on its structure on a vision and the big data system (Chen et al., 2012), in line with creative thinking and strategic leadership for the quality of investment decisions and innovative expectations that have become a vital and indispensable component. For the continuation and prosperity of the organization's activity. Therefore, the United Arab Emirates attaches great importance to concerted efforts in ensuring a better life for future generations, directly affecting people's lives, such as health, education and the economy. In addition to the state’s keenness to build global partnerships. To enhance the utilization of the unprecedented services provided by artificial intelligence technologies, and their role in improving human life, which transcends geographical borders to include the entire world. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to study the relationship between the concept of a smart city, the objectives of building and analyzing its motives, and to clarify the technologies that support the city, and how to face the problems and challenges caused by big data for smart cities. In addition to the application of strategic leadership practices as the mainstay of development and the real wealth of the nation to bring about change and development, and the need to focus on the quality of investment decisions, and this task is not achieved except under conscious leadership based on an advanced strategy that supports the culture of innovation and new practices. © 2021, Allied Business Academies.

"A methodological framework for futures studies: integrating normative backcasting approaches and descriptive case study design for strategic data-driven smart sustainable city planning","2020","10.1186/s42162-020-00133-5","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85102312238&doi=10.1186%2fs42162-020-00133-5&partnerID=40&md5=9baa5e9d9c87bcf2b983521c16da811d","Originally proposed as an alternative to traditional energy planning methodology in the 1970s, backcasting is increasingly applied in futures studies related to sustainability, as it is viewed as a natural step in operationalizing sustainable development. This futures study is concerned with data-driven smart sustainable urbanism as an instance of sustainable urban development—a strategic approach to achieving the long-term goals of urban sustainability. This is at the core of backcasting, which typically defines criteria for a desirable (sustainable) future and builds a set of feasible and logical pathways between the state of the future and the present. This paper reviews, discusses, and justifies the methodological framework applied in the futures study. This aims to analyze, investigate, and develop a novel model for data-driven smart sustainable cities of the future as a form of transformative change towards sustainability. This paper corroborates that the backcasting approach—as applied in the futures study—is well-suited for long-term urban problems and sustainability solutions due to its normative, goal-oriented, and problem-solving character. It also suggests that case study research is the most effective way to underpin and increase the feasibility of future visions. Indeed, the case study approach as a research strategy facilitates the investigation and understanding of the underlying principles in the real-world phenomena involved in the construction of the future vision in the backcasting study. The novelty of this work lies in the integration of a set of principles underlying several normative backcasting approaches with descriptive case study design to devise a framework for strategic urban planning whose core objective is clarifying which city model is desired and working towards that goal. Visionary images of a long-term future based on normative backcasting can spur innovative thinking about and accelerate the movement towards sustainability. The proposed framework serves to help researchers in analyzing, investigating, and developing future models of sustainable urbanism, smart urbanism, and smart sustainable urbanism, as well as to support policymakers and facilitate and guide their actions with respect to transformative changes towards sustainability based on empirical research. © 2020, The Author(s)."

The shift from TOD to TOM, we argue, involves some rethinking of what (and who) cities are for, and paying careful attention to how investments in transit infrastructure serve to define, materially and symbolically, urban and regional relations and identities. Through an engagement with the scholarship on planning for urban industry, smart growth, and transit-oriented development, we argue that the first challenge is to make TOM thinkable. By this we mean not only how we abstractly imagine or conceive future worlds, but also how we create and deploy practical vocabularies of deliberated urban change that actively help to mobilize new conversations about critical places in our changing and changeable cities and regions. We link this challenge of the “thinkability” of TOM to a brief case study in the city of Tacoma, WA. Copyright © 2020 Dierwechter and Pendras."

Some of the greatest challenges for today's architecture are multifunctionality, energy saving and sustainability — problems that insects have partially solved during their evolution. Entomologists have collected a huge amount of information about the structure and function of such living constructions and surfaces. This information can be utilized in order to mimic them for applications in architecture. The main technology areas, in which insect-inspired ideas can be applied, are the following: (1) new materials, (2) constructions, (3) surfaces, (4) adhesives and bonding technology, (5) optics and photonics. A few selected examples are discussed in this short review, but having more than one million described insect species as a source for inspiration, one might expect many more ideas from entomology for insect-inspired biomimetics in architecture. The incorporation of additional knowledge from insect biology into architecture will improve performance of future buildings. However, biologists still do not have a complete understanding of structure-function relationship of insect materials and construction. Hence, many technological areas will benefit from additional basic entomology research. Also the screening for new inspirations from insects is likely to remain an important research field in the near future. © 2020 Elsevier Inc."

In Gauteng Province, South Africa, government housing aims to improve quality of life, reduce poverty and inequality, and transform unsustainable urban forms. This paper draws on survey and interview data to explore the social justice and environmental sustainability outcomes of Gauteng’s government housing programmes. The data reveal improved access to basic services and amenities. However, the developments tend to be poorly located with regard to economic opportunities, and residents are forced to explore other income generation opportunities. This paper highlights the complex interplay between justice and sustainability, where the outcomes are aligned in some instances and conflictual in others.

Formulation of policy and implementation instruments is vital tool to reinvent Waste Management Theory. Wastes disposal is a global phenomenon. As a result of theoretical analysis, urban transformation amidst economic development poses environmental degradation. Progress is inevitable, hence urban transformation occurs. The upward pressure from economic development creates downward pressure on environmental degradation. This condition when exhibited longer than necessary, stagnation proliferates and cities turned into an ecological sacrificial zone. To mitigate, formulation of policy instruments as government sticks must transpire. And at the end of the spectrum, regulations and policies embodied in the implementation instruments based on Waste Management Theory must be supported by ecoinnovations. These innovations inclusive of new ideas, new behavior, processes, and products in sync in a Waste Management Program measured through environmental preservation/restoration, economic resilience, and social wellbeing commonly called as the “Triple bottom-line”.

Through exploring the relationship between cities’ green boosterist rhetoric, affordability and social equity considerations within greening programmes, this paper examines the extent to which, and why, the degree of green branding – that is, urban green boosterism – predicts the variation in city affordability. We present the results of a mixed methods, macroscale analysis of the greening trajectories of 99 cities in Western Europe, the USA and Canada. Our regression analysis of green rhetoric shows a trend toward higher cost of living among cities with the longest duration and highest intensity green rhetoric. We then use qualitative findings from Nantes, France, and Austin, USA, as two cases to unpack why green boosterism correlates with lower affordability. Key factors determining the relation between urban greening and affordability include the extent of active municipal intervention, redistributional considerations and the historic importance of inclusion and equity in urban development. We conclude by considering what our results mean for the urban greening agenda in the context of an ongoing green growth imperative going forward. © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2019."

Global and local policies promote and advocate the eco–city as the most environmentally sound model of sustainable urbanism. It is argued that the eco–city strategies and solutions are expected to deliver positive outcomes in terms of minimal demand on energy resources and thus minimal environmental impacts. Moreover, it has recently been suggested that the eco-city needs to embrace and leverage what advanced ICT has to offer, particularly with regard to sustainable energy systems, so as to improve and advance its contribution to the goals of environmental sustainability. This paper examines how the eco–city especially its core environmental dimension is practiced and justified in urban planning and development with respect to sustainable energy systems and their integration with data-driven smart technologies at the district level. To illuminate this urban phenomenon accordingly, a descriptive case study is adopted as a qualitative research methodology where the empirical basis is formed by urban planning and development documents combined with secondary data and scientific literature. To provide a theoretical foundation and produce a rationale for this study, this paper first provides a state–of–the–art review of the field of ecological urbanism in terms of its foundations, models, strategies, research issues, as well as data–driven smart technological trends. This study shows that the Eco-city District of Stockholm Royal Seaport uses green energy and data-driven smart technologies as the key strategies and solutions for achieving the environmental objectives of sustainable development in terms of lowering energy consumption and mitigating pollution. This entails conserving and decreasing the demand for energy through renewable resources (i.e., sun, wind, and water), bio–fuelled Combined Heat Power system, large-scale smart grid system, energy management, sustainable waste management, and passive solar houses. This research enhances the scholarly community’s current understanding of the emerging phenomenon of the smart eco-city with respect to the synergic potential of the integration of its sustainable energy strategies with data-driven technology solutions for advancing environmental sustainability. © 2020, The Author(s)."

From a broad perspective, it considers the impact of human activities (using dierent resources) and natural conditions on local environments. Urban development has been identified as one of the most important reasons for environmental and social degradation. To address the complexity of sustainability and its impact, policymakers need to be equipped with the right toolkit to foresee the integrated eect of projects and plans on urban sustainability more eectively in their policy design. In this paper, we propose a tool to assess the sustainable performance of urban areas through a common framework of indicators which provides an integrated measurement based on the relative efficiency of key input variables on desirable and undesirable outputs. Using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), we propose a procedure for determining the relative efficiency of relevant urban areas, proposing this method as a candidate for integrated sustainability measurement. The selection of variables is based on dimensions which can be addressed from a political perspective for achieving more desirable outputs, or reducing the undesirable ones, controlling for key resources as much as possible. Our analysis takes a comprehensive scope including an environmental and socioeconomic perspective. This will be useful to identify weaknesses and strengths to improve the integrated performance of cities. Our array of indicators, based on standardized key performance indicators (KPIs) will enable policymakers to gather an insightful impact of their proposals in urban sustainability carrying out a global sustainability impact assessment through DEA.

At the core of sustainable urban form is the spatial pattern of the different types of the physical objects character-izing the built-up areas of settlements at different spatial scales. The spatial features of urban design is key to producing the benefits of sustainability and enacting its effects as outcomes of processes. However, it has been difficult to evaluate how and to what extent sustainable urban forms contribute to sustainability and to judge whether or not a certain sustainable urban form is actually sustainable. Therefore, there is a need to find more effective ways to address and implement the spatial scaling of sustainable urban form in an attempt to increase the positive outcomes of sustainability. This relates to the emerging model of sustainable cities, which is increasingly being enabled by urban computing and intelligence in terms of planning and design under what has been termed “data-driven smart sustainable cities”. This paper analyzes and discusses the emerging conceptions of and approaches to spatial scales that should be considered in the planning and design of data-driven smart sustainable cities of the future. In doing so, it highlights the innovative potential of urban computing and intelligence for enhancing and transforming the spatial scaling of sustainable urban form. I argue that data-driven technologies allow sustainable urban forms to monitor, understand, and analyze the different aspects of their spatial scaling for generating the kind of designs that improve sustainability. Conceiving spatial scales as outcomes of processes and planning accordingly hold great potential for attaining the goals of sustainability. Sus-tainability outcomes are multi-scalar in nature, which justifies the need to integrate spatial scales that have clear synergies in their management and planning and need to be coupled. This synergic integration produces combined effects that are greater than the sum of the separate effects of spatial scales with respect to sustainability benefits. © 2021 The Author(s)."

These marked changes are motivated by the increased need to tackle the problematicity surrounding sustainable cities as quintessential complex systems in terms of their development planning, operational management, and fragmentary design strategies and technology solutions. That is to say, sustainable cities are increasingly embracing and leveraging what smart cities have to offer in terms of big data technologies and their novel applications in an attempt to effectively deal with the complexities they inherently embody and to monitor, evaluate, and improve their performance with respect to sustainability—under what has been termed “data-driven smart sustainable cities.” This new area is a significant gap in and of itself—as it is still in its infancy—that this paper seeks to fill together with to what extent the integration of sustainable urbanism and smart urbanism is addressed and what directions and forms it takes. Using a compelling evidence synthesis approach, this paper provides a comprehensive state-of-the-art literature review of the flourishing field of data-driven smart sustainable cities. This study corroborates that big data technologies will change sustainable urbanism in fundamental and irreversible ways, bringing new and innovative ways of monitoring, understanding, analyzing, planning, and managing sustainable cities. It reveals that the evolving development planning approaches and operational management mechanisms enabled by data-driven technologies are of crucial importance to increase and maintain the contribution of sustainable cities to the goals of sustainability in the face of urbanization. However, what smart urbanism entails and the way it functions raises several critical questions, including whether the policy and governance of data-driven smart sustainable cities of the future will become too technocentric and technocratic respectively, but also with regard to other aspects of social and environmental sustainability. Addressing these important contemporary concerns is of equal importance in achieving the desired outcomes of sustainability. This review and critique of the existing work on the prevailing and emerging paradigms of urbanism provides a valuable reference for scholars and practitioners and the necessary material to inform them of the latest developments in the burgeoning field of data-driven smart sustainable cities. In addition, by shedding light on the increasing adoption and uptake of big data technologies in sustainable urbanism, this study seeks to help policymakers and planners assess the pros and cons of smart urbanism when effectuating sustainable urban transformations in the era of big data, as well as to stimulate prospective research and further critical debates on the topic. © 2021 The Author"

As such, the highly important concept of water–energy nexus will be emphasised and domestic wastewater will be partly considered for water recycling and the rest for energy recovery. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: Distribution of daily domestic water consumption among different household uses and the population in the residential area are the two governing parameters in the practical calculation of daily wastewater generated. Therefore, domestic wastewater will be initially estimated based on population, and in turn, the amount of greywater will be found from the per cent distribution of water use. After segregation of greywater, the energy equivalency of the rest of the wastewater, known as blackwater, will further be calculated. Besides, the long-term average precipitation data of the geographical location (Istanbul) are used in determining safe and sound rainwater harvesting. Harvesting is considered to be only from the roofs of the houses; therefore, surface area of the roofs is directly taken from an actual residential site in Turkey, housing the same population which is constructed in four stages. Similarly, the fictitious eco-city in Istanbul is assumed to be constructed in a stage-wise manner to resemble real conditions. Findings: The water consumption of the fictitious eco-city ABC is considered as 15,000 m3/day by taking the unit water consumption 150 L/capita.day. Therefore, total water savings through on-site reuse and reuse as irrigation water (9,963 m3/day) will reduce water consumption by 64 per cent. Minimum 40 per cent water saving is shown to be possible by means of only greywater recycling and rainwater harvesting with a long-term average annual precipitation of 800 mm. The energy recovery from the rest of the wastewater after segregation of greywater is calculated as 15 MWh/day as electricity and heat that roughly correspond to electricity demand of 1,300 households each bearing four people. Research limitations/implications: A fictitious eco-city rather than an actual one located in Istanbul is considered as the pilot area in the study. So far, an eco-city with population around 100,000 in Turkey does not exist. An important implication relates to rainwater harvesting. The amount of safe water to be gained through precipitation is subject to fluctuations within years and, thus, the amount of collected rainwater will highly depend on the geographical location of such an eco-city. Practical implications: The study covering rough calculations on water savings and energy recovery from domestic wastewater will act as a guide to practitioners working on efficient water management in the eco-cities, especially in those that are planned in a developing country. Originality/value: Practising water–energy nexus in an eco-city of population 100,000 regarding water savings and energy recovery from wastewater forms the originality of the study. Sustainable water use and energy recovery from wastewater are among the emerging topics in environmental science and technology. However, safe and sound applications are lacking especially in the developing countries. Guiding these countries with practical calculations on both water gain and energy recovery from wastewater (blackwater) is the value of the work done. Moreover, Istanbul is deliberately selected as a case study area for various reasons: its annual rainfall represents the worlds’ average, it is one of the most crowded megacities of the world that supply water demand from the surface water reservoirs and the megacity has not yet significantly increased wastewater reuse and recycling practices. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited."

We challenge the dominant, deficit-based frame of informal work, which can dispossess workers, reduce their collective power, and undercut the social and environmental value their work generates. Instead, thinking historically, relationally, and spatially clarifies the essential role of informal work for urban economies and highlights their potential for promoting sustainable cities. It also reveals how growth-oriented economies reproduce environmental destruction, income inequality, and poverty, the very conditions impelling many to informal work. Rather than formalization, we propose reparation, an ethic and practice promoting ecological regeneration, while redressing historic wrongs and redistributing resources and social power to workers and grassroots social movements. Informal workers produce environmental, economic, and social value for cities. Often, policy elites overlook this value, proposing formalization and relying on deficit-based framings of informal work. In this perspective, we argue that thinking historically, relationally, and spatially clarifies the essential role of informal work, highlighting their potential for promoting sustainable cities. Rather than formalization, we propose reparation, an ethic and practice promoting ecological regeneration, while redressing historic wrongs and redistributing resources and social power to workers and grassroots social movements. © 2020 Elsevier Inc."

The processes of green-oriented urban development are dynamic and complex systems influenced by socioeconomic and eco-environmental elements. The interactions between these elements cannot be well considered and treated in previous assessment researches. This study constructs the driving force-pressure-status-impact-response (DPSIR) framework, Shannon's entropy and coordinated development index model to reflect the interactive effects and coordinated relationship. The model is applied to measure the green coordinated development performance in four municipalities directly under the central government and 15 sub-provincial cities from 2007 to 2016. Results show that the green coordination has been the priority for the development of most cities. The level of coordinated development has increased during the decade, but the overall level is not high. The cities in the southern coast is greener than the northern regions. The driving force has the most significant impact on green-oriented urban development. The pressure and response subsystems have made great progress with the implementation of a series of green-oriented strategies during the decade. The upgrading of socioeconomic driving force, the amending of environmental impacts and the improvement of status should be the focuses for the green-oriented urban development in China. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd"

This article investigates the growing use of those concepts in policy in a developing country in the Arab world, taking Jordan as a relevant case, using document qualitative analysis as a primary method supported by the word frequency method. It brings together several national to local level policies, that address bottom-up and top-down challenges, developed after a shock, the Syrian refugee crisis that changed the scenario of policy development. The article aimed to understand the extent of the use of sustainability and resilience in policies in the Jordan case. Results indicate that those terms are often used in an ambiguous manner, which may lead to misleading in some cases. Results also highlight that the interest of policymakers is shifting from sustainability to resilience. However, it is still not the focus of policies that is changing: it is a simple exchange of “buzzwords”. This study is relevant to countries experiencing rapid population growth caused by refugees and those aiming to move toward or increase their urban sustainability and resilience through policymaking in the Arab world and beyond. © 2020 Institution of Chemical Engineers"

The paper aims to identify novel methodologies for smart reuse of heritage sites with a pluralist past as integral to inclusive urban development. Design/methodology/approach: SSC concepts in the global literature are studied to define a new reference framework for integrated urban planning strategies in which cultural resilience and co-creation matter. This framework, augmented by UNESCO’s holistic recommendation on the Historic Urban Landscape (HUL), was tested in two investigative projects: the historic centre of South Africa’s capital Tshwane and the proximate former Westfort leprosy colony. Findings: The research confirms that SSC concepts need enlargement to become more inclusive in acknowledging “cultural diversity” of communities and engaging “chrono-diversity” of extant fabric. A paradigm shift in the discourse on integrated urban (re)development and adaptive reuse of built heritage is identified, influenced by resilience and sustainability thinking. Both projects show that different architectural intervention strategies are required to modulate built fabric and its emergent qualities and to unlock embedded cultural energy. Originality/value: Together with a critical review of SSC concepts and the HUL in relation to urban (re)development, this paper provides innovative methodologies on creative adaptation of urban heritage, reconciling “hard” and “soft” issues, tested in the highly resilient systems of Tshwane. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited."

In the process of counteracting the negative impacts of urban sprawl such as ineffective land-use and its related environmental problems, urban void spaces tend to behave as strategic places for promoting resilient and sustainable urban development. These dispersed urban voids within the urban fabric are mainly a result of poor urban planning and public policy system and the rapidly changing social, economic, and functional aspects. Researchers advocate that these urban void spaces have an immense potential to be used as ideal locations for architectural interventions that have the ability to recycle existing spaces and upgrade infrastructure. This research focuses on the urban voids that are found especially within the residential neighborhood in Chennai namely Mylapore. The paper puts forth an attempt to assess the ability of urban voids in promoting resilient and liveable sustainable development. The study first assesses the built environment in terms of the urban spatial quality, identifies the existing urban voids in the neighborhood and analyses their context and setting by classifying them into three different types of urban void spaces namely reserve voids, remnant voids and defunct voids. Secondly, the research develops a resilient and liveable cities framework. Later, the identified urban void spaces are compared against the developed framework and the potential of these void spaces in, promoting resilient and liveable urban development is explored. The research findings highlight that there are many unexplored urban voids in the city of Chennai, which have the potential of being upgraded and aid in promoting resilient and liveable sustainable urban development. The research further suggests that each up-gradation measure needs to be considered as a piecemeal approach of an integrated urban transformation and regeneration of the entire city with adequate development guidelines. © 2021, VDE Verlag GmbH.

In-depth analyses of UPT network by exploring the topological structure and passenger travel features can help explain the mechanisms driving reliable UPT operations. Based on complex network theory, we proposed a robust model for a Bus-Subway double-layered network (B–S DLN) from the structural and functional perspectives. The following indicators were used to quantify the structural robustness of B–S DLN: average path length (APL), relative size of giant component (RSGC) and global network efficiency (GNE). The functional robustness was measured using the ratio of passenger flow loss (R). Using urban traffic data from the Xicheng District of Beijing, we analyzed the cascading failure of B–S DLN based on a nonlinear load-capacity model with two capacity control parameters: α and β. The simulation results show that α and β significantly impact the cascading failure process of B–S DLN. An increase in β or decrease in α can enhance the network's ability to resist cascading failure. The parameter control method revealed that the B–S DLN achieves strong robustness when α = 0.2 and β = 0.5. Comparing the network robustness under a random attack and intentional attack, the B–S DLN is more robust under an intentional attack than in the random attack mode. This indicates that the robustness of B–S DLN can be significantly improved by rationally increasing station capacities. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd"

However, most of the norms that set general guidelines for urban policy predate the transformations that the smart city concept has brought about in the way cities are appropriated and perceived by society, and even today, studies on how these regulations collaborate to make cities smarter and more sustainable. This work contributes to filling this gap by investigating the main guidelines of the Brazilian City Statute that have the greatest potential to contribute to having smarter and more sustainable Brazilian cities. To prioritize the sixteen guidelines of the City Statute, the methodology used consisted of a survey carried out with professionals working in the concerned field. The results show that the sixteen guidelines were evaluated as important for increasing the intelligence of cities, of which five were evaluated as having the most priority, these five were related to the governance of cities. Considering the scarcity of resources in Brazilian cities, these five guidelines contribute so that municipal governments can direct their efforts towards what has the most priority. © 2020 by the authors."

A growing body of research links urban design with residents' transportation behaviour, such as rates of driving and use of public transportation. However, the effect of urban design on other forms of environmentally sustainable behaviour has not been as widely explored. Recycling is an important aspect of sustainability and the recycling activities of urban residents require further attention. We examine the relationship between urban design and recycling practices at the census metropolitan area (CMA) level in Canada using aggregated data merged from three secondary sources: the 2005-2006 Household and the Environment Survey conducted by Statistics Canada; the 2006 Census; and Gordon and Shirokoff's (2014) classification of Canada's urban neighbourhoods. The results demonstrate that there is a significant relationship between urban development patterns and household recycling practices at the CMA-level, when controlling for demographic factors. We conclude that urban design is related to residents' sustainability behaviours in multiple, complex ways. Copyright © 2020 by the Institute of Urban Studies.

We cited the opinions of urban planners and politicians and referred to relevant theories and standards to achieve this objective. An assessment of Dhaka being divided in accordance with the concept of city development strategies (CDS) reveals considerable deficiencies in most aspects of public goods and services provisions. Whilst splitting Dhaka into separate sections supports the 'World City Hypothesis' it is not without criticisms. Resource constraint and oversight to address those deficiencies make it very difficult for Dhaka's authorities to achieve sustainable urbanisation. Therefore, stringent decisions and appropriate strategies should be implemented by the Bangladeshi government to resolve these deficiencies and mismanagement to make the city both liveable and sustainable.

Smart congestion management allows road users to avoid congested areas, decreasing pollutant concentration. Accurately predicting congestion propagation is difficult however, due to the dynamic non-linear behavior of traffic flow. With the rise of Internet of Things devices, there are now data sets available that can be used to provide smart, sustainable transport solutions within cities. In this work, we introduce long short-term memory networks for the prediction of congestion propagation across a road network. Based on vehicle speed data from traffic sensors at two sites, our model predicts the propagation of congestion across a 5-min period within a busy town. Analysis of both univariate and multivariate predictive models show an accuracy of 84–95% depending on the road layout. This accuracy shows that long short-term memory networks are suitable for predicting congestion propagation on road networks and may form a key component of future traffic modelling approaches for smart and sustainable cities around the world. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd"

This offers the prospect of building models of smart sustainable cities functioning in real time from routinely sensed data. This in turn allows to monitor, understand, analyze, and plan such cities to improve their energy efficiency and environmental health in real time thanks to new urban intelligence functions as an advanced form of decision support. However, prior studies tend to deal largely with data-driven technologies and solutions in the realm of smart cities, mostly in relation to economic and social aspects, leaving important questions involving the underlying substantive and synergistic effects on environmental sustainability barely explored to date. These issues also apply to sustainable cities, especially eco-cities. Therefore, this paper investigates the potential and role of data-driven smart solutions in improving and advancing environmental sustainability in the context of smart cities as well as sustainable cities, under what can be labeled “environmentally data-driven smart sustainable cities.” To illuminate this emerging urban phenomenon, a descriptive/illustrative case study is adopted as a qualitative research methodology§ to examine and compare Stockholm and Barcelona as the ecologically and technologically leading cities in Europe respectively. The results show that smart grids, smart meters, smart buildings, smart environmental monitoring, and smart urban metabolism are the main data-driven smart solutions applied for improving and advancing environmental sustainability in both eco-cities and smart cities. There is a clear synergy between such solutions in terms of their interaction or cooperation to produce combined effects greater than the sum of their separate effects—with respect to the environment. This involves energy efficiency improvement, environmental pollution reduction, renewable energy adoption, and real-time feedback on energy flows, with high temporal and spatial resolutions. Stockholm takes the lead over Barcelona as regards the best practices for environmental sustainability given its long history of environmental work, strong environmental policy, progressive environmental performance, high environmental standards, and ambitious goals. It also has, like Barcelona, a high level of the implementation of applied data-driven technology solutions in the areas of energy and environment. However, the two cities differ in the nature of such implementation. We conclude that city governments do not have a unified agenda as a form of strategic planning, and data-driven decisions are unique to each city, so are environmental challenges. Big data are the answer, but each city sets its own questions based on what characterize it in terms of visions, policies, strategies, pathways, and priorities. © 2020, The Author(s)."

This paper presents an SSC performance model for city MFM clusters under uncertainty. The proposed model is universal and is based on material flow analysis (MFA) methodology. The presented analysis helps to determine the conditions for rhythmic deliveries with the use of the multi-IRTs. The coefficients of rhythmic deliveries for multiple intelligent reconfigurable trolleys (IRTs) and the capacity loss of freight elevators allow us to periodically assess the sustainability processes in city MFM clusters related to the flow materials. These assessments are the basis for the decision-making and planning of SSCs. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

This is due to the fact that they have been effective in significantly reducing the energy consumption of buildings. A typical BMS is composed of smart devices that communicate with one another in order to achieve their purpose. However, the heterogeneity of these devices and their associated meta-data impede the deployment of solutions that depend on the interactions among these devices. Nonetheless, automatically inferring the semantics of these devices using data-driven methods provides an ideal solution to the problems brought about by this heterogeneity. In this paper, we undertake a multi-dimensional study to address the problem of inferring the semantics of IoT devices using machine learning models. Using two datasets with over 67 million data points collected from IoT devices, we developed discriminative models that produced competitive results. Particularly, our study highlights the potential of Image Encoded Time Series (IETS) as a robust alternative to statistical feature-based inference methods. Leveraging just a fraction of the data required by feature-based methods, our evaluations show that this encoding competes with and even outperforms traditional methods in many cases. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd"

Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) is used for developing and maintaining a sustainable and environmental friendly transportation system leading to the evolution of the concept of a Green City. The expansion and development of green cities goes side by side with the development of smart cities. Internet-of-Vehicles (IoV) is an advanced version of transportation mechanisms to enhance the benefits mentioned above. Several authors have proposed various security transportation schemes, however, the response time and communication overhead still need to be considered to encourage business developments, and expanding the recycling's. In this paper, we have proposed an intelligent transportation mechanism that categorizes each device into various categories depending upon its communication behavior using decision based tree making system. Additionally, an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) method is proposed to further examine and analyze the continuous flow of data. The proposed mechanism is further validated through MATLAB simulator against number of metrics over a baseline method. The simulated results suggest that the proposed scheme leads to 89% efficiency in terms of better detection of legitimate nodes, altered records, records accuracy and response time during sensing of vehicles. © 2020 Elsevier B.V."

Big data technologies are seen as a powerful force that has great potential for improving and advancing urban sustainability thanks especially to the IoT. Therefore, they have become essential to the functioning of sustainable cities. Besides, yet knowing to what extent we are actually making any progress towards sustainable cities remains problematic, adding to the conflicting, or at least fragmented, picture that arises of change on the ground in the light of the escalating urbanization trend. In a nutshell, new circumstances require new responses. One of these responses that has recently gained prevalence worldwide is the idea of “data-driven smart sustainable cities.” This paper sets out to identify and integrate the underlying components of a novel model for data-driven smart sustainable cities of the future. This entails amalgamating the prevailing and emerging paradigms of urbanism in terms of their strategies and solutions, namely compact cities, eco-cities, data–driven smart cities, and environmentally data-driven smart sustainable cities. This amalgamation is grounded in the outcomes of the four case studies conducted on six of the ecologically and technologically leading cities in Europe. This empirical research is part of an extensive futures study, which aims to analyze, investigate, and develop a novel model for data-driven smart sustainable cities of the future using backcasting as a strategic planning process. We argue that the proposed model has great potential to improve and advance the contribution of sustainable cities to the goals of sustainability by harnessing its synergistic effects thanks to data-driven technologies and solutions. This new model is believed to be the first of its kind and thus has not been, to the best of our knowledge, produced, nor is it currently under investigation, elsewhere. ©2020 Tamkang University, All rights reserved."

Smart-green integration in urban regions stimulates the development and implementation of the smart sustainable city (SSC) concept. The present research aims to analyse and classify modern approaches to this concept, as well as to identify which one is the most promising. Both rejecting and affirmative approaches to the topic of SSC were taken into account. We conceptually investigated and systematised modern affirmative approaches — technocentric, socio-economic, green economic and human-oriented ones. The analysed data on the smart sustainable city concept includes scientific works published and indexed in the international citation databases (Scopus and Web of Science), reports of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, the United Nations General Assembly, the International Energy Agency, as well as the authors’ survey results from previous research. The paper highlights the current trend of the dominance of sustainable and human-oriented approaches in the smart sustainable city concepts and the growing importance of smart urban communities. The examination of the EU case study demonstrated the important role of sustainable development and wastewater treatment in evaluating and ranking smart sustainable. The obtained results demonstrate that 75 % of SSCs from the Lisbon ranking stated waste treatment as their priority. Only 7 of 28 (25 %) chosen cities did not achieve great results in this area. This fact proves the priority of waste treatment in the development of the smart sustainable city concept. The findings confirm that the research results could be implemented in smart sustainable cities around the world. © Vukovic Natalia A., Larionova Viola A., Morganti Pierfrancesco. Text. 2021"

This has a clear bearing on their performance with respect to the contribution to and balancing of the goals of sustainability. This situation is compounded by the negative consequences of the expansion of urbanization, an irreversible global trend involving a multitude of environmental, social, economic, and spatial conditions that pose unprecedented challenges to policymakers and planners. The underlying argument is that more innovative solutions and sophisticated methods are needed to enable sustainable cities to tackle the kind of problems and complexities they embody. This in turn brings us to the question related to the weak connection between sustainable cities and smart cities as approaches as well as their extreme fragmentation as landscapes, both at the technical and policy levels. Therefore, sustainable cities need to embrace and leverage what smart cities have to offer so that they can optimize, enhance, and maintain their performance and thus achieve the desired outcomes of sustainability. This paper aims to develop a novel model for data-driven smart sustainable cities of the future, and in doing so, it provides a strategic planning process of transformative change towards sustainability. This model combines and integrates the prevailing paradigms of sustainable urbanism and the emerging paradigms of smart urbanism —based on the outcomes of the four case studies conducted on compact cities, eco-cities, data–driven smart cities, and environmentally data-driven smart sustainable cities. As the core of this aggregate model is how to bring about the different forms of infrastructural transformations needed to reach a vision of a sustainable future in the era of big data. Especially, it has become feasible to attain important improvements and advancements of sustainability by amalgamating sustainable cities and smart cities thanks to the proven role of advanced ICT and the untapped potential of data-driven technologies. © 2021 The Author(s)."
"Are green cities sustainable? A degrowth critique of sustainable urban development in Copenhagen","2021","10.1080/09654313.2020.1841119","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85094884379&doi=10.1080%2f09654313.2020.1841119&partnerID=40&md5=2b55e4cfc254067d92fce903844909fc","This paper proposes a case-based degrowth critique of sustainable urban development strategies. Copenhagen, European Green Capital in 2014, is considered a role model of planning for sustainability. Does this hold in a degrowth perspective? Sustainable development assumes that environmental impacts can decline while the economy grows. Degrowth maintains that such a process of absolute decoupling is infeasible. Analyzing Copenhagen’s planning documents in this perspective, I find three factors that make the city’s sustainability strategy ineffective for ecological sustainability. First, Copenhagen’s strategy for climate neutrality is based on externalization: only emissions produced locally are counted. Meanwhile, emissions produced outside of the city for products and services consumed locally remain high. Secondly, policies focus on the efficiency of activities rather than their overall impact: efficiency gains are considered reductions of impact, but really mean slower growth of impact. Finally, sustainability measures are proposed as a ‘green fix’, to increase competitiveness and promote economic growth, leading to increased consumption and impact. Analyzing the critical case of Copenhagen in a degrowth perspective, sheds doubts on sustainable urban development, but does not imply the rejection of all its typical planning measures. This induces reflections on how these results can contribute to a degrowth-oriented urban planning. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

It first argues that green place branding is a process steeped in historicial and political features that are specific to a place. Second, it explores the relationship between local environmental policy making and green place branding through a critical analysis of two European cities – Stockholm and Hamburg – which were European Green Capital (EGC) in 2010 and 2011 respectively. The paper concludes that with the EGCA, local governments were able to generate public attention, mobilise firms and develop new public–private partnerships to get the economic benefits that accompany enhanced green technology exports and greater ecotourism. The experience of the two cities considered here therefore suggests that an ambitious environmental agenda and ‘green’ city branding can be compatible. © 2020 Liverpool University Press.

"Sustainable city storytelling: cultural heritage as a resource for a greener and fairer urban development","2020","10.1108/JCHMSD-05-2019-0043","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083048967&doi=10.1108%2fJCHMSD-05-2019-0043&partnerID=40&md5=82b7d308415da79ace6a2df24768a600","Purpose: In the past years, the importance of the cultural economy has led urbanism to a new perspective. Simultaneously, the main international institutions have pointed out the need to shift the urban economy into a sustainable one, green and energy efficient. The confluence of both flows explains why the imaginaries of the urban future are related to the concept of creative cities. Hence, the new economic engine of the cities should be founded on art, creativity and culture, all of them understood as clean energies. This study aims to show the crucial role of cultural heritage as a propeller of a new kind of urban development, more flexible and democratic, based on the construction of the city as a communicational, collective and open effort. Therefore, the city is conceived as a cultural heritage platform where tangible and intangible, social and creative interactions happen. Within this context, urban narratives appear as a dynamic material drawn on the possibilities offered by the heritage received from the past as a resource to be used for re-thinking and re-shaping the future. Design/methodology/approach: The approach of this paper is based on a profound analysis of historical cities, mainly in the European context, supported by the work carried out within the H2020 ROCK project. The cities within the project are: Athens, Bologna, Cluj-Napoca, Eindhoven, Lisbon, Liverpool, Lyon, Torino, Skopje and Vilnius. A wide variety of case studies coming mainly from these cities have been considered to understand better the theoretical point of view on the role of heritage, urban development and city branding. The information about cultural heritage projects used as case studies has been collected and selected coming from the direct work made on the field and the communication open with institutions and cultural stakeholders in every city. Even more, parallel seminars on cultural heritage and city branding organized within the project have allowed the authors to gather very valuable, updated and fresh information on these issues in every particular case. Findings: The study proves that cultural heritage has been traditionally underrated as a mechanism for developing the future of the city and its communicative strategy. Cultural heritage appears as a practical tool for constructing more cohesive urban communities based on the use of public space and shared memories as storytelling platforms. The capacity of resiliency and sustainability revealed by cultural heritage through the time is, as well, a clear reference to construct a potential sustainable city, socially, culturally and environmentally. Social implications: Cultural heritage projects are shown as a perfect way to build stronger communities. Through the engagement and participation of citizens, urban storytelling reinforces a more open, real and sustainable city able to face the challenges of contemporary life (gentrification, pollution, mobility, etc.). Like that, heritage appears as a feasible tool for including citizens coming from all ages and backgrounds in the construction of a collective narrative of the city, based on the past and looking at the foreseen. Originality/value: This study tries to relate fields that traditionally have remained not well connected: urban development, city branding and cultural heritage. The study demonstrates that cultural heritage is crucial as an urban narrative tool and consequently, as a planning/branding mechanism. Moreover, cultural institutions and cultural projects are very relevant platforms for social interaction, inviting citizens to have a more active role in the construction of the city as a collective communicational effort based on a network of social and cultural relations. Storytelling turns up as a new key element for communicating the city from grassroots, in a sustainable, democratic and inclusive manner, far away from the traditional top-down official perspective. Crowdsourcing methods are very powerful for establishing a shared and cohesive city brand, now rooted in its cultural and social foundations and not the marketing campaign clichés. Finally, storytelling emerges as a creative resource that enhances the social, cultural and economic layout of the city, forcing urbanists to include a greener, fairer and more democratic perspective in the future of cities. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited."

While criticized by many for its scientific, social and political vagueness, the concept of the sustainable city has nonetheless continued to frame material and political efforts in urban redevelopment. From a perspective grounded in the pragmatic sociology of critique, this article takes this phenomenon as evidence of an international movement to generate not just political pronouncements or technical fixes, but a new order of worth, from the concept of the sustainable city. After presenting the pragmatic sociology of critique and the application of this body of social research as it pertains to better understanding sustainable urban development, we reflect on the factors that challenge the acceptance of the sustainable city as an order of worth, or as a mode and manner of justifying significant decisions in the public domain, recognizable and understandable to a majority. For efforts to create the sustainable city to justify themselves, socioculturally, in this way, the work demands a clear test of worthiness. This article illustrates the search for an adequate test through a review of two distinct efforts to generate new systems of assessment for sustainable building projects, and points out the contrasting nature of these two tests: one which aims to be accessible to thoroughgoing public debate fit to transform a context toward a political discourse of urban sustainability as well-being; the other that interprets the need for a test as affirmation of expertise related to the unfolding climate emergency. © 2020 by the authors."

With estimates that around 6.7 billion people will live in cities by 2050, 21st century city planning decisions will play a critical role in achieving the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). They will determine the city structure and access to health-enhancing (or health-damaging) urban environments, and ultimately lifestyle choices that impact both individual and planetary health. Benchmarking, monitoring and evaluating city planning policies and interventions is therefore critical to optimise urban outcomes. In 2017, the UN adopted a global SDG indicator framework, calling for complementary national and regional indicators to be collected by member countries. UN Habitat has also developed an indicator action framework specifically for cities. This paper examined the extent to which the UN indicators will help cities evaluate their efforts to deliver sustainability and health outcomes. It identified inconsistencies between the two UN indicator frameworks. Many of the SDG indicators assess outcomes, rather than the comprehensive and integrated ‘upstream’ policies and interventions required to deliver outcomes on-the-ground. Conversely, the UN Habitat framework incorporates intervention indicators, but excludes health outcome indicators. A more comprehensive approach to benchmarking, monitoring and evaluating policies designed to achieve healthy and sustainable cities and assessing spatial inequities is proposed. © 2019 Elsevier B.V."

However, eRCVs are commonly equipped with oversized batteries which not only contribute to the majority of the weight of the vehicles but also remain a consistent weight, independent of the stage of charge (SoC), thus crucially jeopardising the significance of eRCVs in sustainability and economic strategies. Hence, customising the battery capacity in such a way that minimises its weight while storing ample energy for stalwart serviceability could significantly enhance its sustainability. In this study, taking only addresses as input, through an emergent two-stage data analysis, the energy required to collect refuse from a group of addresses was predicted. Therefore, predictions of the battery capacity requirement for the target location are possible. The theories and techniques presented in this paper were evaluated using real-life data from eRCV trials. For the same group of addresses, predicted results show an averaged error rate of 8.44%, which successfully demonstrates that using the proposed address-driven energy prediction approach, the energy required to collect refuse from a set of addresses can be predicted, which can provide a means to optimise the vehicle’s battery requirement. © 2020 by the authors.

In this study, based on the traffic conditions of 2013 in Dublin, Ireland, the impact of a change in transport infrastructure, a traffic regulation change, speed limit changes and fleet composition changes on air quality and air pollution related public health were assessed. Two pollutants are considered in this study: NO2 and PM2.5. A traffic model, emissions model, dispersion model and a health impact model were adopted. The construction of new infrastructure and changes in traffic management were predicted to have contrasting effects on different parts of the city, bringing little benefit to the city as a whole. The mortality incidence change brought about by changes in NO2 concentration due to reductions in speed limits were predicted to be an increase of 22.4 deaths in 2013. A fleet composition change from diesel to petrol vehicles was predicted to reduce the PM2.5 and NO2 concentration and relevant mortality incidence for the whole city. The study highlighted the importance of the consideration of all possible affected areas within a city. It also highlighted the balance of the safety issues and the environmental health impact, when assessing the impact of traffic management strategies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd"

This paper contributes to the existing literature with an analysis of FFCS trips using rental data collected directly from operators' websites, paying special attention to the most frequent trips. The added value of this research is that it provides the first analysis of the more FFCS demanding districts in the city of Madrid.

One of the most challenging scenarios will be met in ultra-dense networks that are deployed in densely populated areas. In this particular case, mobile network operators should benefit from new assessment metrics and data science tools to ensure an effective management of their networks. In fact, incorporating architectures allowing a cognitive network management framework could simplify processes and enhance the network’s performance. In this paper, we propose the use of composite indicators based on key performance indicators both as a tool for a cognitive management of mobile communications networks, as well as a metric which could successfully integrate more advanced user-centric measurements. Composite indicators can successfully synthesize and integrate large amounts of data, incorporating in a single index different metrics selected as triggers for autonomous decisions. The paper motivates and describes the use of this methodology, which is applied successfully in other areas with the aim of ranking metrics to simplify complex realities. A use case that is based on a universal mobile telecommunications system network is analyzed, due to technology simplicity and scalability, as well as the availability of key performance indicators. The use case focuses on analyzing the fairness of a network over different coverage areas as a fundamental metric in the operation and management of the networks. To this end, several ranking and visualization strategies are presented, providing examples of how to extract insights from the proposed composite indicator. © 2020 by the authors.

However, by imagining nature as a new mode of urban purification, much effort in the name of the green city inverts and reproduces dualistic understandings of natural and built space. In response, we disrupt the normative dialectics of purity and dirt that sustain this dualism to expose the untidy but fertile ground of the green city. We draw together Ash Amin’s four registers of the Good City–relatedness, rights, repair and re-enchantment–with the artworks of the Australian visual ecologist Aviva Reed. Our work seeks to enrich the practice of more-than-human urbanism through ‘dirt thinking’ by imagining the transformative possibilities in, of and for the dirty green city. © 2020, © 2020 Geographical Society of New South Wales Inc."

This study compares the municipal solid waste management attributes of cities in Vietnam under uncertainty. The uncertainties include the interrelationships among the attributes, linguistic preferences and qualitative information on the attributes. This study applies exploratory factor analysis to test the validity and reliability of the proposed attributes. Fuzzy set theory is used to translate the linguistic references into the qualitative attributes of municipal solid waste management. The decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory is used to address the interrelationships among the attributes. This study identifies the causal interrelationships among attributes using qualitative information, and a set of 14 attributes is defined and found to be valid and reliable for measurement. The results show that technical integration and social acceptability are the aspects that drive municipal solid waste management. Treatment innovations, safety and health, economic benefits, and technology functionality and appropriateness are determined to be the linkage criteria. The distinctions between cities are identified, Hanoi focuses on the institutional and organizational administration framework, whereas resource efficiency is an aspect of specific concern in Danang, and Ho Chi Minh City prioritized financial and operational requirements and facilities and infrastructure requirements. The implications for theory and practice are discussed. © 2019 Elsevier B.V."

"Smart Eco-City Strategies and Solutions for Sustainability: The Cases of Royal Seaport, Stockholm, and Western Harbor, Malmö, Sweden","2020","10.3390/urbansci4010011","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85150602554&doi=10.3390%2furbansci4010011&partnerID=40&md5=0a3854fa74dd20937c9ae9c4ba6ec63f","Sustainable urbanism is seen today as one of the keys towards unlocking the quest for a sustainable society. As a central paradigm of sustainable urbanism, the eco-city is promoted by global and local policies as one of the preferred responses to the challenges of sustainable development. It is argued that eco-city strategies are expected to deliver positive outcomes in terms of providing healthy and livable human environments in conjunction with minimal demand on resources and thus minimal environmental impacts. As such, it is pertinent to examine how the eco-city model and especially its three sustainability dimensions is practiced and justified in urban planning and development at the local level. This is motivated by the increased interest in developing sustainable urban districts. In this light, this study seeks to answer the following two questions: What are the key strategies of the eco-city district model, and in what ways do they mutually complement one another in terms of producing the expected tripartite value of sustainability? To what extent does the eco-city district model support and contribute to the environmental, economic, and social goals of sustainability? To illuminate the phenomenon of the eco-city district accordingly, a descriptive case study is adopted as a qualitative research methodology, where the empirical basis is mainly formed by urban planning and development documents in two eco-city districts—Royal Seaport, Stockholm, and Western Harbor, Malmö, Sweden—in combination with qualitative interview data, secondary data, and scientific literature. This study shows that the eco-city district models of SRS and Western Harbor involve mainly design and technology, supported with behavioral change, as key strategies and solutions for achieving urban sustainability. Design encompasses greening, passive solar houses, sustainable transportation, mixed land use, and diversity. And technology comprises green technologies, energy efficiency technologies, and waste management systems. Design contributes to the three goals of sustainability, and technology contributes mostly to the environmental and economic goals of sustainability. Behavioral change is associated with sustainable travel, waste separation, and energy consumption. Moreover, at the core of the eco-city district model is the clear synergy between the underlying strategies in terms of their cooperation to produce combined effects greater than the sum of their separate effects with respect to the benefits of sustainability. Further, this study demonstrates that while the environmental, economic, and social goals of sustainability are represented in eco-city district strategies on a discursive level, institutionalized planning practices show that the environmental goals remain at the core of planning, while the economic and social goals still play second fiddle. Nevertheless, new measures have recently been implemented in Western Harbor that are expected to strengthen their influence over urban development practices, whereas the Royal Seaport program mainly focuses on the environmental and some economic aspects, which is a shortcoming that should be recognized and dealt with. © 2020 by the authors."

Substantial research considering urban areas as whole units has demonstrated a close relationship between urban land expansion and demographic urbanization. However, the impacts of the urban land-use structure (ULUS) on sustainable city growth from the perspective of UPD dynamics have largely been ignored. Based on the understanding of human–land interactions in the process of city evolution, we present a holistic theoretical framework for the impacts of changing ULUS on UPD dynamics. Taking 331 cities proper in China as the study objects, we found that the designation of urban land has mostly depended upon land substitution resulting from the high economic returns of land used for secondary and tertiary industries and residential purposes. This is induced by the increasing scarcity of urban land and people's primary requirements for the dwelling and employment functions of a city rather than its living-environment function. The results confirmed that the holistic theoretical framework is effective for understanding the impacts of changing ULUS on UPD dynamics, and that taking consideration of these impacts in the structural reform of urban land supply is significant for promoting sustainable city growth. This study also provides inspiration for understanding the uncertainties relating to sustainable city growth based on identification of city shrinkage and growth patterns. We discuss regionally differentiated policies relating to structural reform of urban land supply and strategies for coping with city shrinkage. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd"

Portland, Oregon, is an internationally renowned leader in the implementation of BGI and showcases many best practice examples. Nonetheless, a range of interdisciplinary barriers and uncertainties continue to cloud decision making and impede wider implementation of BGI. In this paper, we synthesize research conducted by the “Clean Water for All” (CWfA) research project and demonstrate that interdisciplinary evaluation of the benefits of Portland’s BGI, focusing on green street bioswales and the East Lents Floodplain Restoration Project, is essential to address biophysical and sociopolitical barriers. Effective interdisciplinary approaches require sustained interaction and collaboration to integrate disciplinary expertise toward a common problem-solving purpose, and strong leadership from researchers adapt at spanning disciplinary boundaries. While the disciplinary differences in methodologies were embraced in the CWfA project, and pivotal to providing evidence of the disparate benefits of multifunctional BGI, cross-disciplinary engagement, knowledge coproduction, and data exchanges during the research process were of paramount importance to reduce the potential for fragmentation and ensure research remained integrated. © 2020 The Authors.

In this regard, the study points out that the use of green energy is an important part of sustainable development. Environmental problems are a matter of global concern. Hence sustainable development is one of the approaches to end the harmful anthropogenic impact. The work includes quantitative assessment methods, for example, statistics, quantitative analysis, analogy, and synthesis. As a result, the analysis confirms that the effective development of a smart green city is impossible without the introduction of several renewable energy sources, the integrated use of which will reduce the likelihood of problems with the city's energy supply. Likewise, the outcome accentuates that the desire to fully switch to renewable energy sources (RES) can be accompanied by several problems as the creation of RES technologies does not always take the risk of abnormal situations into account. In conclusion, the research findings are recommended to be taken into consideration by researchers in the field of smart and sustainable cities development, as well as urbanists and economists for designing future smart green cities based on renewable energy sources. © 2021 River Publishers."

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to review relevant literature to clarify the role of urban agriculture in sustainable cities. The search for literature was guided by themes such as: a)urban agricultural practices, b)indicators for the measurement of sustainable cities, c)economic, social and environmental benefits of urban agriculture, and d)negative effects of urban agriculture on the city. The results from a synthesis of the literature indicate that urban agriculture supports the economic, social and environmental sustainability of cities. However, if the discussion gives credence to only the economic dimension of sustainability, then urban agriculture loses the debate. This is because the economic benefits of prime city land that is used used for non-agricultural purposes (such as commercial or industrial)is profound. However, the social and environmental functions of responsible urban agriculture, particularly in reducing the rift between urbanisation and nature, may be difficult to quantify. These social and environmental functions underscore the importance of urban agriculture in the city landscape. The paper concludes by arguing that focussing on only economic sustainability in the urban agriculture-sustainable city discourse is a travesty of the idea of sustainable development. The paper presents practical steps that can be taken to preserve agriculture in cities towards their sustainability. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd"

Growing concern over human impacts upon coastal waters and global strategic goals for healthier cities requires that coastal cities develop innovative ways to inspire and empower communities to embrace and cherish city seascapes. Coastal city communities have much to gain from a healthier relationship with the sea. This paper proposes a collaborative community-led marine park concept that celebrates a city's connection to the marine environment, enhances sustainable economic prosperity and enables communities to participate in activities that deepen understanding, value, care and enjoyment of the city seascape. A city marine park (CMP) is not a marine protected area because it does not have biodiversity and heritage protection or ecosystem governance as a primary goal and does not aim to restrict human activities. A CMP enables city communities to collaborate towards a shared vision of elevated status and value for the city seascape. A CMP considers socio-economic and geographical context, including land-sea connectivity, and is integrated within a coastal city's strategic urban planning. This paper highlights core themes of a CMP and the diverse and wide-ranging benefits from coordinated activities that better connect the city community with its seascape. If co-created by the coastal city community and civic leaders, a CMP will form an enduring spatial nexus for progress toward healthy cities addressing multiple interlinked global sustainable development goals. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd"

The urgency for a radical transition towards sustainability in a long term-vision has brought with it several new concepts, such as smart urbanism, and models, such as smart city, eco-city, sustainable neighborhood, eco-district, etc. While these terms are fascinating and visionary, they often lack a clear definition both in terms of theoretical insight and empirical evidence. In this light, this contribution aims at defining a conceptual framework through which to further substantiate the blurred concept of eco-district and sustainable neighborhood. It does so by reviewing the concepts of smart urbanism and sustainable neighborhood/eco-districts in the literature, including also references to other well-known sustainability-oriented models of urban development. It then explores whether several indicators, emerging from the analysis of exemplary case studies of sustainable neighborhoods in Europe, can be used to clearly identify the characteristics of a sustainable approach at the district scale. The analysis, built on a review of existing literature, allows for both the clarification of several issues related to these fields of inquiry, as well as for the identification of the potential bridges to link these issues. © 2019 by the authors."

However, there is a boundary, where cannot be researched beyond to understand the deeper dimensions of the sacred geometries, without geometrical and mathematical analysis. This research examines the geometries of the spatial relationships established by ritual space in Kandy, and its relevance to the city landscape and architecture, to understand sustainable city and sacred geometries. Ritual space created through performing Esala perahera for 15 continuous days is analysed for the purpose, in order to explain sacred dimensions and depth of the place, beyond the boundaries of architectural and landscape analyses. The method of study is by a geometrical analysis of ritual space, architectural elements and the city landscape, exploring geometry in two, three and higher dimensions; to understand the sacred geometries and geographies. It examines the higher dimensions of the centre, axis, and the circular motion and discusses sustainable city geometries. The geometrical analysis is done by utilizing architectural and landscape analytical diagrams developed in a previous study, employing a phenomenological, anthropological, ethnographical research approach. This study reveals further insights of the place; people, social/cultural/religious system, architecture, topographical location, the city and spiritual dimension of the space; where this place cannot be easily understood in isolation, by employing either research approach.

When considering smart and sustainable cities, this big data generates useful information and insights to citizens, service providers, and policy makers. Transforming this data into knowledge allows for empowering citizens' cognition as well as supporting decision-making routines. However, several operational and computing issues need to be taken into account: 1) efficient data description and visualization, 2) forecasting citizens behavior, and 3) supporting decision making with intelligent algorithms. This paper identifies several challenges associated with the use of data analytics in smart sustainable cities and proposes the use of hybrid simulation-optimization and machine learning algorithms as an effective approach to empower citizens' cognition and decision making in such ecosystems. © 2012 IEEE."

Generic models of four urban built forms are developed including pavilion, terrace, court and a newly introduced tunnel-court which are used to compare and contrast their land-use performance and density characteristics. Selecting plot ratio and site coverage as the most popular and appropriate density indicators, the simultaneous relationship to each of the considered urban built forms is shown graphically with the number of storeys, plan depth and cut-off angle as the main variables of interest. For existing urban areas, the resulting graphs provide a robust tool for statistical analysis of contexts such as climate, economy, energy and crime potential and establish their relationship to form and density. To show the value of the contribution, analysing 32 case studies from 19 cities in different global locations showed an insignificant relationship between climate and form/density of urban areas, while practically depicting that urban areas built in court form acquire higher cut-off angle compared to terrace form urban developments. For the planning of future urban areas, the resulting relationships provide an application-oriented urban planning tool to facilitate the most effective land-use method in order to achieve sustainable cities. Examples showing the potential of the tool for future statistical energy and social analysis of urban areas are provided. Finally, a relative comparison shows that the newly-introduced tunnel-court form achieves the greatest density while pavilion achieves the lowest. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd"

In some parts of the world its main function is to feed the rapidly growing population while in others it is more associated with lifestyle and environmental issues. Undeniably, UA provides opportunities for sustainable city development. UA can support all pillars of sustainable development: ecological, economic, and social. However, depending on existing circumstances certain pillars may be influenced more than others. In this paper we concentrate on urban allotments in Andalusia and take Baeza as an example of a city with an interesting approach to urban gardening. We attempt to answer the question how urban allotments in Baeza affect the city's sustainable development and what remains to be done to make this influence more effective. Our study showed that allotment gardens in Baeza endorsed all three pillars of sustainable city development. However, developing broader community relations on the city scale, revival of declining local grocery market and dissemination of environmental initiatives which allotment gardens may also promote and facilitate was missing. © 2019 Barbara Maćkiewicz et al., published by Sciendo."

Design/methodology/approach: A case study approach as a research design was used. In total, 18 semi-structured interviews were conducted among managers for administrative departments and municipal company CEOs. Findings: This study found that the environmental performance indicators are used by department managers mainly for resource allocation, control and for teaching the employees. The CEOs of the municipal companies use the environmental indicators for communicating with external stakeholders and see the indicators primarily as marketing tools. The main reason why the environmental performance indicators are used in the municipality can be the strong demand from the local politicians to push the “green agenda,” and therefore the managers have to comply. Research limitations/implications: As in any case study, generalizations from the research should be made with care, but since this is only one municipality, further research is needed to find additional evidence. Practical implications: The findings of this study have a number of implications for future practice, and it is worth mentioning that clear guidelines for how the information could be made more useful for managers at the managerial level in Växjö municipality (VM) are requested for both the municipal managers and the CEOs. Social implications: Overall, this study strengthens the idea that environmental performance indicators could be used to a larger extent for communicating with external stakeholders both for municipal departments and companies. Originality/value: The research adds to the literature by examining different patterns of using environmental performance indicators in a unique setting – in VM, which is called “the greenest city in Europe” and is one of the “pioneers” in environmental work and extensively uses performance indicators. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited."

To realise coexistence between nature and mankind in the city and establish healthy, comfortable, convenient, and technology-enabled living spaces for people in the city without compromising the ecological environment, the concept of eco-city development is proposed. In this study, a questionnaire survey regarding key success factors for urban environment development from the perspective of eco-city was conducted on the general public in Fujian Province of China. Totally 500 questionnaires were distributed and 388 solid samples were returned with a solid return rate of 78%. According to the analysis results of the returned questionnaires, among the three dimensions of eco-city development, the most important one is ‘cyclical metabolism of the city’, followed by ‘self-sufficiency’ and ‘mutu-ally beneficial coexistence’. Moreover, among the 12 evaluation indictors of the three dimensions, the five most important indicators are: resource recycling, regenerative resources, natural resources, proper treatment, and benign modulation. Based on the findings of this study, suggestions are made in the hope of providing assistance in the realisation of eco-city development. © 2019, Scibulcom Ltd. All rights reserved."

Planning support systems with manual design and post-design evaluations impose major challenges in exploring huge design spaces. Generative design systems largely neglect the wicked nature of design problems and lack appropriate representation methods and simulation tools at the urban scale. To tackle those challenges, this research developed a Smart Design framework featuring urban design decision-making reinforced by artificial intelligence-aided design (AIAD). The Smart Design framework treats urban design as an emergent pattern formation processes with contextualized and dynamic objectives. The framework integrates design thinking, advanced artificial intelligence search techniques (e.g. genetic algorithms), urban scale performance simulations, and participation to better inform decision-making. Through four major stages, the framework combines the ideas of Science for Design and Design in Science. The significance and potential of the Smart Design framework are demonstrated in an urban design study of Gangnam superblocks in Seoul, South Korea. The study explores sustainable urban forms in the high-density, super-complex, and hyper-consumptive environment of Gangnam, which can also be found in many other Asian contexts. The case study illustrates how the framework identifies design solutions for sustainable city development in the process of participatory decision-making through the co-evolution of design problems and solutions. © The Author(s) 2019."

This study was designed as a qualitative single case study of a smaller city (Östersund) situated in the northern part of central Sweden. Data were collected from semi-structured interviews with regional destination management organisations (DMOs), infrastructure managers, and real estate managers for shopping areas, as well as growth and development managers for the municipality and business entrepreneurs. Data were also collected from secondary sources such as the internet and publications. The results of the study show that different stakeholders play various roles in sustainable development for Östersund. Such development is highly dependent on tourism, mainly summer tourism and events. The famous events have been important in building the brand of the city, and tourists know the area because of them. The conclusions are that sustainable city development needs stakeholders who collaborate or even cooperate across sectors, and particularly those who see their potential cross-sectorally. It is not just the tourism industry that contributes to tourism development; shopping and creative business entrepreneurs are vital for the city as well. Sustainable development is also important not just for the tourists but also for the inhabitants of the city. The inhabitants’ pride and satisfaction in their city and their word-of-mouth recommendations are the key drivers for the brand of the city, which contributes to its sustainable development. © 2019 WIT Press."

Municipal solid waste management is thus a significant hurdle for urban societies as it consumes a large chunk of public funds, and, when mishandled, it can lead to environmental and social hazards. Some of the prerequisites required for effective waste management are the monitoring of bins, timely collection of bins, and prioritization of those areas which produce more solid waste. In this paper, we propose an optimal route recommendation system for waste carriers vehicles to effectively collect solid waste based on the profile of a particular area. This article contributes with a multi-objective optimization approach to generate a route by minimizing the route distance and maximizing the amount of waste. Then, a family of evolutionary methods is employed to solve the proposed objective function and find the optimal route for waste carrier vehicles. The experiment is carried out on the real-world solid waste data of Jeju Island, South Korea. The data is processed to predict the behavior of people of a specified grid location in terms of waste disposal. Therefore, the recommendation system caters to the predicted waste across a set of bins inside the area, and considering the constraints such as total allowed distance and time, proposes a route that is best in terms of distance (fuel consumption) and waste collection. Different use cases are illustrated to signify the proposed system, and results indicate that it can be a step forward for the implementation of smart cities, which is the goal of Jeju Island. © 2013 IEEE."

To raise environmental awareness, World Environment Day has been celebrated on 5 June since 1974, and while the concept of a “green city” has started to gain momentum in India, high population density and land scarcity has forced people to settle near ecologically sensitive areas within conventional development models, which has led to the rapid deterioration of resources. The crucial starting point for this paper is to find out whether the knowledge of the “green city” has had deeper penetration to all sectors of the population. The main objective is to evaluate the extent to which individuals and local governance are involved in the “green city” movement. Our research investigates whether we have responsive and inclusive government institutions with the capacity to deliver services efficiently and equitably. The author has taken Perungudi, which is one of the fastest growing suburbs in Chennai city due to a rapidly growing IT industry, as a case study. This research first divides the Perungudi area into two districts based on the socio-economic status and then investigates local people’s knowledge and perception of the “green city” based on the following tools: (i) a household survey; (ii) secondary reports; and (iii) a transect walk.

In this context, the protection of heritage and tradition as an appeal to identity preservation can provide the stability and balance necessary for community survival in case of risk. The historical and architectural value have exclusively constituted the criteria for identifying built objects to be preserved, but over time, the interest has expanded to the space with ambiental value as a whole, as well as to those minor components that derive meaning “from their co-existence”, contributing to defining the affective value of it. Each built place has an initial aspiration, it translates a history of edification and existence, becoming for us a perpetual testimony and revelation. The place is loaded with his story, with its cultural dimension, becoming a mental reality. In our study we developed the analysis of the affective and emotional value of space, which will be changed in relation to the citizen profile, culture, education, personal and community experience. Therefore, space is not only a physical content but a living experience. The research is based on the case study of the destructured area by the demolition and investments of the communist ruler Nicolae Ceaușescu during the 1980s as a pretext for post-disaster management (after the 4 March 1977 earthquake) and which caused the loss of many monuments and a strong trauma to the deployed population. We propose a methodology of intervention in the affected area on a multicriterial assessment in terms of the balance between the value of the spatial resource reporting value and the spatial resource status. © 2019 EDP Sciences.

By using principal component analysis (PCA) and taking an intellectual capital perspective (all sources of knowledge in human, relational and structural areas), we explore which of the three dimensions used to measure the sustainability of a city-economic, social or environmental-has the greatest effect on a subjective measurement of quality of life. We propose an econometric model based on a tangible production model to study the relationship between the quality of life and sustainability. To that end, we perform an in-depth examination of the different effects on the four dimensions that comprise the measure of the subjective quality of life: satisfaction, mobility, integration and public service. The results of the estimated model of citizens' quality of life confirm the existence of a direct relationship for the 52 European cities under study; however, the least relevant role is played by the environmental dimension, which is still unappreciated by citizens. Conversely, the economic and social dimension are found to be determinants in all cases, except for social integration. Therefore, a key requirement of the management aimed at achieving sustainable development in European cities is to activate the environmental dimension. © 2019 by the authors."

In Hanoi city (Vietnam), the sustainable aspects of the urban landscape evolution are affected by a rapid urbanization, inefficient urban spatial planning, and the pressures of contemporary socioeconomic growth. This paper describes the evolution of urban landscape in Hanoi during the period 1990–2030. The background is the urbanization and the changes in urban planning. Urban land use/land cover of Hanoi city in 1993, 2000, 2007, 2012, and 2015 is described using LANDSAT satellite images. Land use/land cover of Hanoi in 2030 is projected by the Markov–cellular automata, which are a hybrid model of Markov chain analysis, multi-criteria evaluation, and cellular automata. The results show that Hanoi is becoming a metropolis, gradually having more dynamics and more diversity, but having less green in its pattern until 2030. All over Hanoi city, the built-up areas expanded, while the non-built area and water bodies narrowed. Residential, industrial, commercial, and service areas grow increasingly faster and become dense in the southwestern and southeastern parts of the city. New lakescapes and water corridors orient new urban development. Green areas become smaller and more fragmented. Agricultural rings have been cleared and replaced by new urban areas. Planning and managing the urban evolution toward sustainable development are imperative in Hanoi. The methods described in this paper can be effective tools expected to help planners, managers, and residents to deal with these concerns in the future. Moreover, socioeconomic development, environmental protection, improving urban planning efficiency, and integrating local governance into urban planning should be prioritized for a sustainable Hanoi city in the future. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V."

Sustainable forms of transport, such as cycling, are a key issue for cities across the globe, including smart cities, while transport is increasingly becoming part of the Internet of Things (IoT). This article contributes to an understanding of how cars and bicycles are discussed in this context. To do so, 39 relevant EC policy documents (2014-2018) were identified and examined through keyword searches and rigorous document analysis. The results show how the vast majority of policy discussions in this area revolve around cars (including autonomous cars and smart vehicles), while cycling is hardly considered, with a strong affinity between IoT and cars. In addition, recent EC policy debates take place more around IoT than around Smart Cities, while sustainability is not considered much in the IoT context. The conclusion highlights the implications of sustainable urban modes of transport such as cycling being absent from IoT/smart debates, including lack of policy visibility and funding opportunities, underlining the significance of this research, and it also makes policy suggestions for addressing these issues and for future research. © 2019 by the author.

These necessities include the fresh water required by both settlements and commercial operations. The purpose of this study is to analyse the demand for fresh water created by the population growth of Depok in realising its development as a sustainable city. This study uses a quantitative approach presented through narrative analysis. In 2016, the average water requirement of Depok’s population of 2,180,000 people was 3,070 litres/second in the dry season and 5,983 litres/second in the rainy season. Population projections for 2030 suggest that the population of Depok will have increased to 3,543,101 people, and that the average water requirement will then be 4,990 litres/second in the dry season and 9,724 litres/second in the rainy season. Planning alternatives proposed to meet these needs include improving the evaluation of freshwater production capacity and developing freshwater supply systems. Thus, it expected that the projected freshwater needs of Depok in 2030 can be fulfilled. This expectation can be managed and achieved through participation by society and government. However, obstacles are still faced, mainly due to more recent cultural attitudes towards using water. © IWA Publishing 2019. All rights reserved."

Urban management and development face many challenges in the continuous creation of new jobs and prosperity without harming the environment and resources. Most cities in Croatia, especially in the coastal areas, are recognized as tourism destinations: tourism is the most important economic activity. The aim of this paper is to investigate, based on secondary available data, whether having tourism as a generator of the city's overall development is sufficient to make it an attractive place to live. In these times of intensive economic, sociological and cultural changes, tourism destination management needs to recognize and to define a suitable and feasible model, methodology and the means of implementing urban destination development strategy. The mere notion of a tourism destination implies the integral management of all key stakeholders. Faced with negative demographic processes, the underdevelopment of the urban settlements network, with its function and economy, we conclude that national policies need to give special attention to those urban areas that lag behind the national average. Based on that analysis and the conclusions drawn from it, our paper suggests a model of a sustainable transitional city that is economically independent, and which is an attractive place not only for visiting tourists, but also for its residents throughout the year. © 2019 WIT Press"

In this context, carbon mineralization technology has received attention because of its high potential for carbon sequestration, environmental conservation, and economic market value. This project report introduces a national top-down approach for developing and implementing international technology cooperation in the Republic of Korea, focusing on carbon mineralization. The Ministry of Science and Information and Communication Technology (MSIT) leads international technology cooperation, identifies prominent climate technologies, and addresses scientific agendas to presidential meetings. The inter-ministerial bodies established the climate technology roadmap and masterplan for a climate change response. With the support of these inter-ministerial efforts, a National Strategic Project on carbon mineralization was developed by a presidential-level decision as a top-down approach. Furthermore, the demonstration of this technology was emphasized to enhance the possibility of success in commercialization. This project also includes demonstration of a pilot, sequestering 6000 tons of CO2 and manufacturing 30,000 tons of carbonate. This successive and holistic approach, comprising of a range of hierarchical levels of government, is recommended for deriving a high impact on global society of prominent climate technology. © 2019 by the authors."

The City of Kitakyushu, Japan has actively implemented eco-friendly policies since 1967 and recently inspired the pursuit of sustainable development around the world, especially in the Global South region. However, empirical studies on the effects of green growth policies are still lacking. This study explores the relationship between road infrastructure development and average industrial firm size with air pollution in the city through the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis. Auto-Regressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) and Non-linear Auto-Regressive Distributed Lag (NARDL) methods were applied on nearly 50-years’ time series data, from 1967 to 2015. The results show that the shape of the EKC of industrial growth, measured by average firm size, depends on the type of air pollution: inverted N-shaped relationships with NO2 and CO, and the U-shaped relationships with falling dust particle and Ox. Regarding infrastructure development, on the one hand, our analysis shows a positive effect of road construction on alleviating the amount of falling dust and CO concentration. On the other hand, the emissions of NO2 and Ox are shown to rise when plotted against road construction. The decline of CO emission, when plotted against both industrial growth and road development, indicates that the ruthlessness of the local government in pursuing green growth policies has been effective in this case. However, the story is not straightforward when it comes to other air pollutants, which hints at the limits of the current policies. The case of Kitakyushu illustrates the complex dynamics of the interaction among policy, industry, infrastructure, and air pollution. It can serve as an important reference point for other cities in the Global South when policies are formed, and progress is measured in the pursuit of a green economy. Finally, as an OECD SDGs pilot city and the leading Asian green-growth city, policymakers in Kitakyushu city are recommended to revise the data policy to enhance the findability and interoperability of data, as well as to invest in the application of big data. © 2019, The Author(s)."

In historic cities, the lack of suitable sidewalks for walking led to the gradual elimination of pedestrians. Yazd is a historic city recorded as a world heritage site by UNESCO, which attracts many tourists from all over the world every year. Therefore, preserving the quality of sidewalks in this city is of great importance. In this research, the SCI method was used to investigate the condition of the sidewalks in the studied area.

Using massive, passively-collected mobile phone data, we introduce a novel framework to estimate building occupancy at unprecedented scale. We show that, at urban-scale, occupancy differs widely from current estimates based on building types. For commercial buildings, we find typical occupancy rates are 5 times lower than current assumptions imply, while for residential buildings occupancy rates vary widely by neighborhood. Our mobile phone based occupancy estimates are integrated with a state-of-the-art urban building energy model to understand their impact on energy use predictions. Depending on the assumed relationship between occupancy and internal building loads, we find energy consumption which differs by +1% to −15% for residential buildings and by −4% to −21% for commercial buildings, compared to standard methods. This highlights a need for new occupancy-to-load models which can be applied at urban-scale to the diverse set of city building types. © 2019, The Author(s)."

Many researchers have emphasized the necessity of including residents' participation in both the smart city concept and the sustainable city development concept, but they do not focus on a coherent linking of these activities during evolution toward a sustainable smart city (SSC). The in-depth case study analysis considered, i.e., three subsequent Wroclaw development strategies (1998-2018) and implementation of the smart city concept in Wroclaw (2015-2018) with particular emphasis on the issue of public participation and sustainable development of the city. The results of study show that in the case of the developments in the activities of smart city and sustainable city development carried out by Wroclaw, it is possible to identify two different approaches to residents' participation in city activities. In Wroclaw, 'residents' participation' in the framework of the sustainable city development activities currently covers all theoretical levels of participation, while within the smart city activities it focuses mainly on the participatory budget and the limited use of ICT. The conducted research indicates that for the implementation of the SSC concept it would be important to integrate these approaches in order to ensure the full range of residents' participation in accordance with theoretical postulates. The conducted analysis therefore covers mostly unexplored area of research, which is important from the point of view of a city's evolution toward becoming a sustainable smart city. The conclusions from the research are also an empirical contribution to the analysis of the changes of cities towards SSC and indicate the need for further, extended research on the undertaken problem. © 2019 by the authors."

The continuous object tracking in WSNs, is a challenging task due to characteristic nature of continuous objects. They can appear randomly, move continuously, and can change in size and shape. Monitoring such objects require tremendous amount of messaging between sensor nodes to synergistically estimate object's movement and track its location. In this paper, we propose a twofold-sink mechanism, comprising of a mobile and a static sink node. Both sink nodes gather information about boundary sensor nodes, which is then used to uniformly distribute energy consumption across all network nodes, thus helping in saving residual energy of network nodes. We develop a mechanism, transformed from K-means algorithm, to find the best sensing location of the mobile sink node. It helps to reduce transmission load on the intermediate network nodes situated between the static sink node and the ordinary network sensing nodes. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme can distinctly improve lifetime of the network, compared to the one-sink protocol employed in continuous object tracking. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd"

However, the main problem, in which many societies are involved, is how to respond to these needs in a sustainable way. One of the ways of responding to these dilemmas in large cities is the purposeful implementation of urban agriculture. Urban agriculture development, as an important issue, requires the adoption of fundamental and logical policies. In this regard, this research was conducted to evaluate the extent of adherence to urban agriculture in Iran’s eight densely populated cities using a new combined approach of the best–worst method (BWM) and weighted aggregated sum product assessment (WASPAS).

However, in cities, this task is complicated due to the constructive geometry that leads to shading between buildings. In this context, this work presents a study of solar access to the facades of buildings in cities. The methodology is based on the determination of the incident annual solar radiation in 121 significant points of each facade considering the twelve representative days of the year. To characterize the influence of the dierent city typologies on solar access, the urban solar coecient is proposed. A study of two neighborhoods in Cordoba (Spain) with dierent urban settings have been analyzed. Specifically, two typologies of neighborhoods have been compared: one with ""L-shaped"" and ""U-shaped blocks"" and another with ""Grouped blocks"". For both of them, the Urban Solar Coecient has been calculated, obtaining a higher mean value for the neighborhood with ""L-shaped"" and ""U-shaped blocks"" (0.317) than for the one with ""Grouped blocks"" (0.260). Accordingly, the results show that urban morphology can influence the Urban Solar Coecient and solar access. Finally, a regression model for each neighborhood has been obtained in order to determine the dependence of the Urban Solar Coecient on neighborhood geometry factors. © 2019 by the authors.

This has placed tremendous pressure on the country's natural resources, including water, energy, and raw materials. Hence, the conventional means of expanding the built environment is no longer appropriate, as it has been found to be one of major causes of climate change and global warming. In the early 1970s, the principles of sustainable development emerged in developed countries, in order to remedy this global issue. During this period, Saudi Arabia experienced dramatic development in all of its industries, but the principles of sustainable development were, to a large degree, overlooked. However, there is now an ambitious Vision 2030 for Saudi Arabia, one of the purposes of which is to promote greater sustainability in the country. This study seeks to assist decision makers to identify the challenges and opportunities of the current Saudi practices of city design, and their related operational aspects, and to enable the adoption of effective measures for implementing sustainable development principles. Employing an ethnographic research methodology, the fieldwork concerned includes a public perception survey, followed by a site inspection, in order to develop an insider's view of the current level of sustainable practice in the city of Najran. A public survey is distributed to well-informed citizens, with the goal of obtaining their insights, and to assess their willingness to embrace green city practices. This is followed by a site inspection visit that seeks to obtain in-depth information regarding site design and operational practices. A checklist of sustainable criteria is adapted from well-known systems. The major outcomes of the study reveal that many challenges are encountered the application of green city principles.

The Tanzanian government prioritizes large-scale modern projects to increase national income and propel world-class urban settlements. Dar es Salaam, Tanzania׳s largest city and main commercial center has experienced remarkable urban development. Unfortunately, its growth has not been consistent with the master plans, which also overlook sustainable urban development aspects. The high urbanization rate has exacerbated the degradation of the city׳s environment, including roadside air quality, solid waste, and water quality. The city׳s ongoing environmental dilapidation has led to a call for a sustainable urbanization to curb past urbanization problems and implement a sustainable future. This work reviews Dar es Salaam׳s available planning documents and examines how master plans can stimulate sustainable urban development. Findings suggest that master plans should not be used as a mere urban growth control tool. Master plans that are designed and conceptualized as a comprehensive strategy and integrated with different aspects of urban development can play a key role in enforcing sustainable urban development for the city. © 2019 Higher Education Press Limited Company"

The relationship model between construction cost and benefit of passive low energy consumption building in coastal green city is studied, which provides a reference for the replacement and maintenance of passive low energy consumption building in coastal green city. A construction cost control model of passive low energy consumption buildings in coastal green cities based on adaptive equilibrium control is proposed. There are three kinds of passive low energy consumption building construction strategy models in coastal green cities, which are conventional construction model, preventive construction model based on game equilibrium control and life cycle maximization prediction model based on passive low energy consumption design, on the basis of which the construction cost of passive low energy consumption building in coastal green city is predicted. The adaptive equilibrium control method is used to construct the mathematical model of construction cost control. The simulation results show that the model can make the construction cost and output capacity of passive low energy consumption building in coastal green city maintain a reasonable economic and applicable proportion relationship, reduce the construction cost of passive low energy consumption building in coastal green city, improve the construction cost capacity of passive low energy consumption building in coastal green city, and the economic benefit is considerable. © Coastal Education and Research Foundation, Inc. 2019."

This paper establishes a simple core–periphery model with monocentric cities, which comprises key forces that shape the structure and interrelation of cities to study the impact of the urban evolution on the environment. We focus on global warming and the potential of unfettered market forces to economize on emissions. The model parameters are chosen to match the dichotomy between average “large” and “small” cities in the urban geography of the United States, and the sectoral greenhouse gas emissions recorded for the United States. Based on numerical analyzes we find that a forced switch to a system with equally sized cities reduces total emissions. Second, any city driver which pronounces the asymmetry between the core and the periphery drives up emissions in the total city system, too, and the endogenous adjustment of the urban system accounts for the bulk of the change in emissions. Third, none of the city drivers gives rise to an urban environmental Kuznets curve according to our numerical simulations. Finally, the welfare-maximizing allocation tends to involve dispersion of cities and the more so the higher is the marginal damage from pollution. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

There is, therefore, an increasingly urgent need to study its impact on the functioning of cities, especially when they implement a sustainable development policy. Therefore, the need to study its impact on cities’ performances is more and more urgent, particularly, when they implement a sustainable development policy. This study discussed the influence of a sharing economy in tourism on city sustainability from the perspective of the Agenda 2030 goals. The main objective of the paper was achieved, thanks to in-depth analysis of the content of secondary sources. Results of the analysis were subjected to the synthesis process, using the tabular method. In Agenda 2030, when diagnosing the importance of this issue, one of 17 goals, i.e., goal 11, and 10 tasks within it, were devoted to the sustainable development of cities. The results of this study showed that sharing economy in tourism has an impact on the implementation of seven of them, but the direction of the impact is diversified. The domination of positive sharing economy (SE) effects was observed in the following areas: providing access to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems for all (Target 11.2) and upgrading slums (Target 11.1), while the negative effects were noticed particularly clearly in implementing Targets 11.6 (reducing the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities) and 11.7 (providing universal access to safe, inclusive and accessible, green and public spaces). © 2019 by the authors."

Two SEA cases were studied using 40 semi-structured interviews and two focus groups. Data are analysed qualitatively employing NVivo software. Participation is assessed using ideal conditions of learning derived from Transformative Learning Theory, and operationalised for this study. Strengths of SEA participation are freedom from coercion and equal opportunity to participate. Notable weaknesses include inaccessibility of SEA documents, inadequate participant funding, and lack of feedback and transparency about the SEA findings. Participants exhibited numerous learning outcomes and associated social actions on urban SWM including waste sorting, recycling and composting (instrumental learning), sharing values and community collaborations on cleanup and recycling (communicative learning), and altering conventional viewpoints from 'waste for disposal' to 'waste as a resource' (transformative learning), including for livelihood opportunities. © 2019 The Author(s)."

In the last decade (from 2001-2011) the acceleration in urbanisation level has increased from 27.81% to 31.16%. According to some documents by the United Nations and the International Energy Agency, India will probably witness the largest increase in urban population in the next four decades followed by China. With the rapid urbanisation and increased income levels, the mobility of people and freight will become even more critical. The quality of the mobility is a key factor in determining the quality of life in any city or town. Many factors such as inadequate public transportation, high fare, no last mile connectivity, poor city bus services etc. contribute to the people choosing personalised mode of transportation over public transportation. There is a dire need to encourage cities to adopt sustainable transportation systems. This paper attempts to understand the challenges and needs of developing sustainable transportation system in Indian cities. The paper examines the case of three mega cities Copenhagen, Tokyo and New York and explores the efforts taken by these cities for making cities more sustainable through green transportation systems. The aim of the paper is to chalk out the possible strategies for green transportation systems which could be followed in Indian cities to make cities more sustainable. © BEIESP."

This article explores how posthuman assumptions embedded in such scripts render the socially embodied human invisible and analyzes cases of their rationalization and enactment within China. The article concludes that understandings of creativity in Chinese urban aesthetics expose premises of globally promoted urban policy scripts more transparently than those informed by European aesthetic traditions. The Chinese city is understood to manifest the creative obsessions of humans rather than to actualize a transcendent, idealized vision separate from that of its human creators. This resembles Guy Debord’s idea that what we see in the world—how the world is architected—is a materialization of triumphant ideologies. The contemporary Chinese city, incentivized by the entrepreneurial state, makes visible Debord’s globally dominant “integrated spectacular.” Once creativity and intelligence are rationalized, the autonomous “creative,” “smart,” “eco” city is branded in a global supply chain of city production. Consequently, the posthuman city need not account for the conditions under which embodied humans are actually inspired to create and adequately compensated for their creations. Rather than attributing the failure of posthuman policies in Chinese cities to Chinese exceptionalism, these cases expose universal fault lines in the policies themselves. © The Author(s) 2018."

Undoubtedly, sustainable development has, since its widespread diffusion in the early 1990s, positively influenced city planning and development. This pertains to the immense opportunities that have been explored and the enormous benefits that have been realized in relation to sustainable urban forms, especially compact cities and eco-cities. However, such forms are still associated with a number of problems, issues, and challenges. This mainly involves the question of how they should be monitored, understood, analyzed, and planned to improve, advance, and maintain their contribution to sustainability and thus to overcome the kind of wicked problems, unsettled issues, and complex challenges they embody. This in turn brings us to the current question related to the weak connection between and the extreme fragmentation of sustainable cities and smart cities as approaches and landscapes, respectively, despite the proven role of advanced ICT, coupled with the untapped potential of big data technology and its novel applications, in supporting sustainable cities as to enhancing and optimizing their performance under what is labeled “smart sustainable cities.” In this respect, there has recently been a conscious push for sustainable cities to become smart and thus more sustainable by particularly embracing what big data technology and its novel applications has to offer in the hopes of reaching the optimal level of sustainability. In the meantime, we are in the midst of an expansion of time horizons in city planning and development. In this context, sustainable cities across the globe have adopted ambitious smart goals that extend far into the future. Essentially, there are multiple visions of, and pathways to achieving, smart sustainable cities based on how they can be conceptualized and operationalized. The aim of this paper is to generate a vision for smart sustainable cities of the future by answering the 6 guiding questions for step 3 of the futures study being conducted. This study aims to analyze, investigate, and develop a novel model for smart sustainable cities of the future using backcasting as a scholarly approach. It involves a series of papers of which this paper is the second one, following the earlier papers with steps 1 and 2. Visionary images of a long-term future can stimulate an accelerated movement towards achieving the long-term goals of sustainability.

It is of great significance to analyse the urban landscape pattern and ecological environment characteristics so as to improve the regional ecological environment and construct the urban landscape security pattern. With Shanghai as the research object, this study involves the urban land use/land cover changes and uses remote sensing technology, GIS technology, landscape pattern analysis and other methods to make the comprehensive analysis and evaluation of the urban landscape pattern and its impact on the urban ecological environment in Shanghai. The results show that with the acceleration of urbanisation, the degree of urban landscape fragmentation is aggravated, and the landscape segmentation is obvious and more complex, which seriously affects air environment and water environment. According to the analysis results, some suggestions are put forward to construct the landscape safety ecological pattern in Shanghai from the view of green city development concept.

Improving the energy efﬁciency of buildings, especially existing ones, is key to combating climate change. This paper uses a business perspective to analyze and compare three major retrofitting interventions under implementation in three different European cities, Nantes, Hamburg and Helsinki, to capture the principal needs and challenges and to identify governance recommendations for local authorities on building retrofitting replication and scale-up strategies. The authors analyze the municipal business models of residential building retrofitting interventions, which are very different from those of private companies, through two innovative business tools: the Value Creation Ecosystem (VCE) and the City Model Canvas (CMC). Sustainable development in terms of social inclusion, environmental protection and financial viability is the principal axis of the study. The bottleneck for residential building retrofitting is owner engagement, due to the high up-front cost. The analysis of the three cities' business models has shown interesting ideas for promoting this type of interventions. The development of a costumer customer interface lead by the municipality; the offering of funding schemes, the promotion of risk-sharing schemes and guaranteed saving, through the implementation of EPC, and the owners' involvement in co-creation strategies using 4 P approaches could all help city governments to increase the ratio of owners willing to participate. These results and the discussion will help public managers to prepare their cities’ strategies in terms of business models when they try to implement building retrofitting projects. © 2019 The Authors"

The study analyzed interviews with 392 citizens from five neighboring cities from a micro-region in southern Brazil. Factorial analysis and linear regression were applied. The investigation recognized three factors for smart sustainable cities evaluation: public services and facilities; material well-being, and environmental well-being. Linear regression reveals that residents' satisfaction with the city is predicated on the material well-being, public services and facilities, environmental well-being, and sense of community, which explain 40.2% of satisfaction with the city. Considering a smart sustainable city viewpoint, the study accomplishes that: (i) policies should be projected from the neighborhood standpoint, due to the facility of understanding shared values (ii) sense of community should be included in policies for smart sustainable city; (ii) policies should be proposed from the neighborhood perspective, due to the facility of understanding shared values; (iii) the design of neighborhoods and cities should prioritize social interactions, with the view to build social capital and facilitate policies implementation. By integrating the smartness to sustainability approaches in the city context, this study intends to contribute to a major discussion on sustainable development, with special attention to residents' evaluation. Finally, the paper offers pertinent outcomes for urban planners and social researchers, by finding factors that influence the sense of community and residents’ evaluation on their city and by offering elements for academic and political and debates. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd"

More and more people are eager to exchange all kinds of information in urban life through an efficient network. Therefore, designing a smart data distribution and transmission mechanism can not only improve people's quality of life but also pave the way for reducing environmental pollution. Optical networks have been widely used in the core network due to high-capacity characteristics. However, in inter-data-center (Inter-DC) optical networks, the coexisted heterogeneous optical devices and multi-granularity network resources bring new challenges to network management and traffic scheduling. Recently, software-defined network (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) have been introduced to enable the unified control for improving network agility and automation. Thus for software-defined multi-granularity Inter-DC optical networks, we propose a list of online service provisioning strategies. Moreover, in terms of the network controller, the novel routing applications are also developed by extended OpenFlow protocol. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate the overall feasibility of proposed solutions in a semi-practical platform. Numerical simulations conducted to quantitatively evaluate the algorithm efficiency also verify the superiorities of improving spectrum efficiency and reducing service blocking probability. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd"

Nevertheless, few studies have explored green city branding and specifically considered the diverse perceptions of multiple stakeholders. Accordingly, this study aims to explore green city branding from the perceptions of multiple stakeholders. Design/methodology/approach: Based on associative network theory, the study uses brand concept maps and network analysis approaches to construct and analyze the content and structure of mental models among local residents and foreign tourists for a green city brand. This study further seeks empirical support for the findings via a survey, using the sample case of Yilan County in Taiwan. Findings: The results of this study reveal that foreign tourists possess a more diverse and heterogeneous brand perception than local residents. Additionally, the study uncovers significant green city brand associations regarding their influences on the behavioral decisions of local residents and foreign tourists. Originality/value: This research is the first attempt to advance the knowledge of green city branding by empirically exploring the green city brand perceptions of multiple stakeholders based on associative network theory.

Localising sustainable development in the Arabian city might require a framework that originates from its reality manifested in the region’s history, culture and religion. Ibn Khaldun’s model seems suitable for planning a sustainable city in the Arab world. The purpose of this paper is to discuss suitability of Ibn Khaldun’s writing to localising sustainable development in the Arabian cities. Design/methodology/approach: The paper used a qualitative research methodology. The researcher investigated the writings of Ibn Khaldun and other scholars who studied his work to derive lessons for planning the sustainable Arab city. Findings: Many of Ibn Khaldun’s concepts lost their accuracy, meanings and intentions in the course of translating his work. Ibn Khaldun’s writings can be the source from which scholars, planners and city administrators derive lessons to assure the sustainable development of human settlements, particularly in the Arab region. The writings of Ibn Khaldun are relevant to the Arab countries. His writings are sensitive to the realities of the Arab world, including geography, environment, history, religion and culture. His writings can support efforts for localising sustinable development in the Arabian cities. Originality/value: Interrogating Ibn Khaldun’s writings can enable scholars, planners, architects and city administrators to elaborate and implement plans for the sustainable Arabian city. The findings of the paper assure that Ibn Khaldun’s analysis is suitable for addressing the urban ills of the contemporary Arabian metropolis as they were in his time. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited."

In this context, green roofs can be an effective tool to both delay and attenuate stormwater runoff peaks, reducing runoff at the same time. Their proper design is a key element for stormwater management in highly urbanized cities. The aim of this paper is to propose an analytical probabilistic approach, to evaluate green roof performance in terms of runoff and vegetation's survival without irrigation, to guide planners in choosing proper values for their design parameters. A great advantage of the method is that it can be applied to different sites and climate conditions; moreover, it involves a significant improvement of the typical analytical probabilistic approach, as a chain of consecutive rainfall events was considered, in order to take into account the possibility that storage capacity is not completely available at the beginning of each event, because of pre-filling from previous rainfalls, as typically happens with green roofs. Finally, to verify the goodness of our developed equations, we applied them to a case study. © 2020 WITPress. All rights reserved."

Using a multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach, this study sought to develop a multiple-criteria model that facilitates the evaluation of green cities’ sustainability, based on cognitive mapping techniques and the Choquet integral (CI). Taking a constructivist and process-oriented stance, the research included identifying evaluation criteria and their respective interactions using a panel of experts with specialized knowledge in the subject under analysis. The resulting framework and its application were validated both by the panel members and a parliamentary representative of the Portuguese ecology party “Os Verdes” (The Greens), who confirmed that the evaluation system created distinguishes between cities according to how strongly they adhere to “green” principles.

Indeed, huge advances in some areas of sustainability knowledge and a multitude of exemplary practical initiatives have been realized, thereby raising the profile of sustainable cities worldwide. The change is still inspiring and the challenge continues to induce scholars and practitioners to enhance existing, and propose new, models. Especially, sustainable urban forms have been problematic, whether in theory or practice, so is yet knowing to what extent progress has been made towards sustainable cities. They are associated with a number of problems, issues, and challenges and thus much more needs to be done considering the very fragmented, conflicting picture that arises of change on the ground in the face of the expanding urbanization. This involves the question of how they should be monitored, understood, analyzed, planned, and even integrated so as to improve, advance, and maintain their contribution to sustainability. This brings us to the issue of sustainable cities and smart cities being extremely fragmented as landscapes and weakly connected as approaches, despite the proven role and untapped potential of advanced ICT, especially big data technology, for advancing sustainability under what is labeled ‘smart sustainable cities.’ Essentially, there are multiple visions of, and pathways to achieving, such cities, which depends on how they can be conceptualized.

Four factors of residential satisfaction were identified—operation and maintenance, comfort and health, architectural and construction quality, and accessibility of GRBs—and these determinants of WTP had different effects on different groups of residents. The mean WTP of the majority (64.5%) of residents was 374 CNY/m2 (about 54 USD), accounting for only 2.2% of the housing price. Four segments of residents with heterogeneous preferences were identified. The dominant segment (accounting for 64.5%) was “Indifferent residents with low WTP”. The second largest segment (accounting for 18.9%) was “Critical residents with 1000 + WTP”, followed by the third largest segment (13.3%) — “High WTP residents driven by comfort and health”, while the smallest segment (3.3%) was “Operation and maintenance-sensitive residents”. The policy implications are that stakeholders should work to enhance the operational performance of GRBs, thereby improving residents’ satisfaction and increasing their WTP. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd"

Urban public transport companies can make a significant contribution to the concept of sustainable city logistics. The customers' perception and satisfaction regarding urban public transport companies can be associated with the increased use of their services. The preference for urban public transport reduces the use of individual car transport, which is linked to the environmental pillar of sustainability. For the customers, the level of the provided service is very important. The article is focused on the evaluation of the outcomes from the primary research concerning the service quality performed by the urban public transport companies in the Hradec-Pardubice residential agglomeration. The goal lies in identifying gaps in service quality. The method used in this article is representative primary research. The primary research was carried out in the form of structured personal interviews with a representative sample of respondents. Selected statistical methods were used to evaluate the data. The results are discussed in the context of published research studies. Research in this article found that respondents are more satisfied with the quality of services performed by the urban public transport companies, but the perception of individual service quality factors varies from one user group to another. The research also confirms a different perceptions regarding customer care and comfort by different age groups of respondents. The article implies that public transport companies should pay attention to setting fare prices for different groups of passengers. © 2020 J. Chocholac et al., published by De Gruyter 2020."

The choice of the most suitable indicator framework is crucial, but difficult, as it requires expert knowledge. To help cities in their choice, this paper compares seven recently published indicator standards for Smart sustainable cities. A taxonomy was developed to evaluate each of their 413 indicators against five conceptual urban focuses (types of urban sustainability and smartness), ten sectoral application domains (energy, transport, ICT, economy, etc.) and five indicator types (input, process, output, outcome, impact). The results clearly discriminate between indicator standards suited for evaluating the implementation of predominantly smart city approaches versus standards more focused on sustainability assessment. A further distinction is possible in standards almost fully oriented towards impacts reached, and standards that allow for progress evaluation according to steps in the implementation process. Some standards provide a narrow focus on output indicators evaluating the progress in implementing smart urban ICT solutions (e.g. number of smart meters installed). Cities are encouraged to complement such evaluations with impact indicators that demonstrate the effects of those solutions. This paper provides guidance for city managers and policy makers to select the indicators and standard that best correspond to their assessment need and goals, and align with their stage in Smart sustainable city implementation. © 2019"

This article conducts an empirical examination across seven convening organizations we describe as “Collaborative Civil Society Organizations” to understand the intentional leadership activities that catalyze cross-sector social partnerships in the context of regional sustainability initiatives. Our research findings suggest that social movement theory can provide insight to inform our understanding of the nature of intentional leadership activities that help to motivate and initiate the formation of these cross-sector social partnerships. By enfolding this literature in the interpretation of our findings, we have articulated an empirically grounded construct of “mobilizing leadership.” We suggest that by approaching regional sustainability initiatives as a social movement, mobilizing leadership has the potential to extend the cosmopolitan view toward building a biosphere consciousness, enabling the development of local multisector interactions in response to global issues of sustainability. © The Author(s) 2017."

This article shows that Sharing Cities are conceived within the alternative political economy of the commons. Bringing a theoretical contribution into dialogue with a practice-oriented book, this paper aims at checking the concept of Sharing Cities against the reality on the ground by reviewing 137 secondary cases: (1) Is communal (non-commercial) sharing a substantial phenomenon? (2) What is the role of technology-and more widely, of intermediation-in sharing practices? (3) If at all, what is being transformed by sharing practices? (4) Are commons depicted in each case? Results show that most cases display a communal form of sharing that is independent of digital platforms, i.e., that the sharing transformation affects all arenas of production and social reproduction across a wide variety of sectors, and it relies on translocal replication rather than up-scaling. With only 26% of cases apparently depicting a commons, this paper argues for a relational epistemology of urban commoning, shifting the focus to more-than-human commoning-communities. Thus, Sharing Cities are captured not only as a set of policy proposals and practices but as the performative depiction of an alternative worldview based on interdependence, ready for the Anthropocene. © 2019 by the authors."

Being responsible for billions of avian deaths, bird-window collisions have been widely studied in the US and Canada, with few studies from Europe, Asia, and Latin America. Thus, there is still a dearth of knowledge regarding this alarming phenomenon in regions where biodiversity and urbanization peek, such as Latin America. In this study, we assessed bird-window collisions in Xalapa, a small-to-medium-sized Neotropical city located in Southeast Mexico. We gathered data under two schemes: (1) a standardized survey procedure and (2) non-systematic records. Regarding the former, we evaluated the role of building and surrounding vegetation traits, as well as the location of focal buildings in driving bird-window collisions. Considering both schemes, we recorded bird-window collisions for 43 species. The most frequent striking groups were hummingbirds and thrushes, which had already been identified as vulnerable given some of their natural and life history traits. Regarding the standardized survey, we found no statistical differences in the number of collisions among seasons; yet, we did record a predominance of strikes from resident bird species over migrants among all studied seasons. Our results show a significant positive relationship between the amount of surrounding vegetation area of the studied buildings and bird-window collision frequency, while building non-glass material area showed a significant negative relationship. Based on our findings and the limitations of our study, we encourage future research to combine systematic and standard surveys throughout the year with citizen science, together with carcass removal assessments and bird density surveys in the immediate vicinity of focal buildings. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

Air pollution causes long-term effects on people. There is an urgent need for protecting people from its profound effects. In general, people are unaware of the levels to which they are exposed to air pollutants. Vehicles, burning various kinds of waste, and industrial gases are the top three onset agents of air pollution. Of these three top agents, human beings are exposed frequently to the pollutants due to motor vehicles. To aid in protecting people from vehicular air pollutants, this article proposes a framework that utilizes deep learning models. The framework utilizes a deep belief network to predict the levels of air pollutants along the paths people travel and also a comparison with the predictions made by a feed forward neural network and an extreme learning machine. When evaluating the deep belief neural network for the case study undertaken, a deep belief network was able to achieve a higher index of agreement and lower RMSE values.

That research developed indicators in the first round based on UN sustainable development goal 11, ASEAN environmentally sustainable city, Korean case study, and domestic green and clean city indicators, and validated the developed indicators in the last two rounds. After consensus analysis, that research obtained 32 assessment indicators categorized by nine criteria. However, these indicators are not prioritized yet due to the limitation of the Delphi technique. Hence, this research aims to prioritize these indicators by applying the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) technique and to confirm whether the levels of importance verified by Delphi can be used for prioritizing or ranking the indicators. This research surveyed potential respondents experienced and working in relevant fields both offline and online. Online surveys were processed through E-mail, Facebook, and LinkedIn. A total of 118 questionnaires were gathered from the surveys, and 16 were inconsistent (consistency ratio > 0.1). The results showed that the highest and lowest weights are 0.0557 and 0.086. The top ten indicators are slum population (0.0557), unemployment (0.0516), crime prevention (0.0470), water supply (0.0469), city’s migration (0.0462), low-income housing (0.0445), solid waste collection (0.0437), labor-force (0.0421), construction safety (0.0400), and traffic congestion (0.0398). The rank of all indicators based on their levels of importance is completely different from the rank of their weights. Therefore, this research confirms that the levels of importance verified by Delphi cannot be used for ranking or prioritizing the consensus indicators. The priority weights in this research would be useful to policymaking, strategic direction, and budget allocation for the development and management of sustainable cities in Cambodia. © 2019 by the authors."

Accordingly, the demand for hiring sustainability professionals is increasing within local governments. However, the job of a municipal sustainability manager is notably understudied as extant literature provides little clarity on who fills these positions, what their job entails, and how they perform their job. This article seeks to address these important research questions by examining the qualifications (who), job responsibilities and work activities (what), as well as the sustainability management competencies that experienced professionals identify as most valuable for performing their sustainability manager job (how). Twenty-six sustainability professionals employed by twenty-five different municipalities across Canada were interviewed. Our results contribute to the public administration literature by providing foundational information on an understudied job that is increasingly important to public performance. Moreover, our findings contribute to the public performance and sustainability management literatures by surfacing eleven competencies linked to sustainability management.

To do so, many of them rely on servitization, the practice of replacing tangible solutions for intangible ones. Considering steel's wide range of applications and its pervasive presence, this article's goal was twofold: Not only to understand how servitization helps sustainable cities, but also the contributions and challenges of the steel present in service-providing. To do so, the criteria of sustainable urban metabolism and circles of sustainability were used to analyze three case studies of servitization: energy, housing, and mobility. The results showed that servitization can provide significant benefits to sustainable cities, while also being able to substantially alter the supply-side dynamics of steelmaking by affecting, most notably, demand. This brought to light how important it is for steelmakers to pay close attention to the service-providing initiatives that may concern their clients and products. Nevertheless, further research is necessary to fully understand all of the effects that servitization can have on all of the commodities involved in its implementation. © 2019 by the authors."

To accelerate sustainable urban transitions a greater understanding of the regime-level processes that enable or constrain translation between long-term visions and short-term action is required. Transition research to date has neglected regime processes, especially cultural-cognitive habits and heuristics, and the role of power and agency. To address this a novel analytical framework is proposed, with transition theory as the basis, additionally drawing on institutional and quasi-evolutionary theory. This framework is tested using Copenhagen as a case study, generating important insights; in particular that normative institutional processes are an effective means for regime actors to coordinate power, affect resource allocation, and impact selection pressures and adaptive capacity. The findings suggests that unless the institutional and quasi-evolutionary processes that drive action are re-configured in line with sustainable city visions then progress will be limited. © 2019 Elsevier B.V."

Conversely, the impact of space on social activities is widely recognized in literature and an impact on voluntary activities is also identified - but it focuses more on wider geographical scopes, comparing regions. Little is known so far about which characteristics of space and governance structures influence voluntary work on a smaller geographical level - such as a city or neighbourhood. In a case study conducted in the city of Trondheim, Norway and the neighbourhood of Saupstad, we elaborate an understanding on the influence of shared spaces on voluntary work. We ask which characteristics of the shared spaces and governance structures foster or limit voluntary activities. Our study is based on observation and qualitative interviews with providers of shared indoor spaces for voluntary work, voluntary organizations and the stakeholders involved (city administration, neighbourhood management, etc.). We applied a multi-scale research approach at a city, neighbourhood and building level to identify challenges and enablers on all urban scales. We have chosen a case study approach for an in-depth qualitative analysis to identify these factors. Our research shows that the physical characteristics of shared spaces such as location, accessibility and facility equipment play an important role in voluntary activities. In the worst case, voluntary work had to be stopped when the shared space was no longer available. On the other hand, there is a great potential of sharing spaces not yet provided for voluntary activities, due to lacking incentives, restrictions on use of these spaces and a lack of cooperation between providers of shared spaces. In particular, the existing governance structure at a neighbourhood level plays an important role in fostering space-sharing and enabling voluntary activities. © 2020 WIT Press."

This is evident in some initiatives taken to create cities with low to zero carbon emissions, build sustainable structures and create higher institutions of learning where sustainability practices are entrenched in their curricula. Examples of the forerunners of sustainable cities are abound; from the Middle East (Education City in Qatar and Masdar City in Abu Dhabi) to Far East (Dongtan Institute in China and New Songdo City in South Korea), new cities imbued with sustainability practices are springing forth. There are 400 big cities and 23 mega cities presently occupying the world urban spaces, with estimates of about one and 10 million inhabitants, respectively. Ironically cities occupy about 2% of the earth surface, they however consume 60–80% of global energy. The global urban population rose from 220 million to about 2.8 billion in the 20th century, and it is projected that by 2050, this will increase to 6.9 billion, which is about 70% of the world population. Therefore, sustainability campaigns, when directed at cities, would have intended impacts due to a number of factors associated with cities: large population, hub of intellectual and social integration, high consumption, etc. In creating modern sustainable cities however, the attention of cities' planners and policymakers alike should be on those goals that come under the banner of sustainability, especially when designing new or retrofitting existing human settlements (the cities); such as human capital development, energy conservation and energy efficiency, water security, efficient use of earth-abundant resources, transportation, building standards, social and economic equity, and food wastes management. Although there are few review articles in the literature that separately deal with individual sustainability fundamentals, there is a dearth of publication consolidating key sustainability principles required for modern cities. This paper reviewed each element needed to make a functional sustainable city. We adopted a simple approach; we explained each sustainability principle, highlighted its core values and gave reasons why it is an important candidate to be considered in making a working city. We critiqued the current sustainable cities by stating reasons for their strengths and explanations for their deficiencies. We engaged the future sustainable cities’ planners to learn from the failures of some of the earlier hurriedly executed sustainable cities in order to have the most important elements of sustainability present in their future project execution. © 2019"

Insight from inhabitants about their cities reveal dimensions and attributes not captured by official indicators. The focus of this study is to define appropriate indicators for sustainability and smartness of cities according to their citizens, considering the idiosyncrasies of local contexts and less notable dimensions pointed out in earlier studies. The scale is based on consolidated metrics, such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals, and the ISO 37120/2017, in association with the European Barometer and American Barometer. The CITYLIFESAT (City Life Satisfaction) scale was tested and validated in Southern Brazil through exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, and discriminant analysis. The results show that citizens' satisfaction is primarily linked to health and safety, well-being, recreation, public transport, walkability, social inclusion and participation, primary services, city attachment, and environment. © 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd."
"Towards a novel model for smart sustainable city planning and development: A scholarly backcasting approach","2019","10.6531/JFS.201909_24(1).0004","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85069918979&doi=10.6531%2fJFS.201909_24%281%29.0004&partnerID=40&md5=2b9986af8a26076921b6d0507aeb11b1","In the early 1990s, the discourse on sustainable development produced the concept of sustainable urban forms that became, and continue to be, a hegemonic response to the challenges of sustainable development. However, such forms have been problematic, whether in theory or practice, and indeed are associated with a number of problems, issues, and challenges. This involves the question of how they should be monitored, understood, analyzed, planned, and even integrated so as to improve, advance, and maintain their contribution to sustainability. This brings us to the issue of sustainable cities and smart cities being extremely fragmented as landscapes and weakly connected as approaches, despite the proven role and untapped potential of advanced ICT, especially big data technology, for advancing sustainability under what is labeled ""smart sustainable cities."" Essentially, there are multiple visions of such cities, and indeed multiple pathways to achieving them. With that in regard, this futures study aims to analyze, investigate, and develop a novel model for smart sustainable city planning and development using backcasting as a scholarly approach. It involves a series of papers of which this paper is the first, and which aims to report the outcomes of Step 1 and Step 2-an overview of a detailed trend analysis and a review of sustainable urban forms-by answering the guiding questions for each step. We argue that a deeper understanding between social, technological, and scientific solutions is required to achieve more sustainable urban forms. Visionary images of a long-term future can stimulate an accelerated movement towards achieving the long-term goals of sustainability. The proposed model is believed to be the first of its kind and thus has not been, to the best of one's knowledge, produced, nor is it being currently investigated, elsewhere. © 2019, Tamkang University."

The aim is to provide new housing indicators that are capable of bringing the concept of sustainability into the cities of MICs. The results reveal that the percentage of influence that single-family housing (SFH) can achieve in the metric established by each system is relatively low. However, considering all of the identified indicators, this influence could increase to 53.16% of the total score in multi-criteria evaluations. Furthermore, a significant lack of indicators for mandatory criteria evaluations was found, with CASA being the only system that considers their inclusion. This paper identifies 37 indicators for multi-criteria assessments and two for mandatory-criteria assessments, providing new perspectives on several topics. Furthermore, the methodology established to obtain the indicators could be useful for other researchers in the identification of new sustainable indicators. © 2019 by the authors."

This article contributes to these ongoing debates about smart and eco-urbanism by focussing on recent urbanisation initiatives in Asia. Our study of India’s Smart Cities Mission launched under the administration of Narendra Modi and China’s All-In-One eco-cities project initiated by Xi Jinpin unfolds in two corresponding narratives. Roy and Ong’s [2011. Worlding Cities: Asian Experiments and the Art of Being Global. Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell] “worlding cities” serves as the theoretical backdrop of our analysis. Based on a careful review of a diverse set of academic literature, policy and other sources we identify five process-dimensions for analysing the respective urban approaches. We show how the specific features of China’s and India’s urban focus, organisation, implementation, governance and embedding manifest both nations’ approaches to smart and eco-urbanism. We argue that India’s Smart City Mission and China’s All-in-One project are firmly anchored in broader agendas of change that are set out to transform the nation and extend into time. The Indian Smart City Mission is part of a broader ambition to transform the nation enabling her “smart incarnation” in modernity. Smart technologies are seen as the key drivers of change. In China the framework of ecological civilisation continues a 5000-year historical tradition of civilisation excellence. By explicitly linking eco-urbanism to the framework, eco-cities become a means to enact ecological civilisation on the (urban) ground. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

As a result, vast troves of data are generated and exploited to operate, manage, organize, and regulate urban life, or a deluge of contextual and actionable data is produced, analyzed, and acted upon in real time in relation to various urban processes and practices. This data-driven approach to urbanism is increasingly becoming the mode of production for smart sustainable cities. In other words, a new era is presently unfolding wherein smart sustainable urbanism is increasingly becoming data-driven. However, topical studies tend to deal mostly with data-driven smart urbanism while barely exploring how this approach can improve and advance sustainable urbanism under what is labeled ‘data-driven smart sustainable cities.’ Having a threefold aim, this paper first examines how data-driven smart sustainable cities are being instrumented, datafied, and computerized so as to improve, advance, and maintain their contribution to the goals of sustainable development through more optimized processes and enhanced practices. Second, it highlights and substantiates the great potential of big data technology for enabling such contribution by identifying, synthesizing, distilling, and enumerating the key practical and analytical applications of this advanced technology in relation to multiple urban systems and domains with respect to operations, functions, services, designs, strategies, and policies. Third, it proposes, illustrates, and describes a novel architecture and typology of data-driven smart sustainable cities. The overall aim of this study suits thematic analysis as a research approach. I argue that smart sustainable cities are becoming knowable, controllable, and tractable in new dynamic ways thanks to urban science, responsive to the data generated about their systems and domains by reacting to the analytical outcome of many aspects of urbanity in terms of optimizing and enhancing operational functioning, management, planning, design, development, and governance in line with the goals of sustainable development. The proposed architecture, which can be replicated, tested, and evaluated in empirical research, will add additional depth to studies in the field. This study intervenes in the existing scholarly conversation by bringing new insights to and informing the ongoing debate on smart sustainable urbanism in light of big data science and analytics. This work serves to inform city stakeholders about the pivotal role of data-driven analytic thinking in smart sustainable urbanism practices, as well as draws special attention to the enormous benefits of the emerging paradigm of big data computing as to transforming the future form of such urbanism. © 2019, The Author(s)."

The main objectives of this study were to collect renewable energy resource data of a hybrid hospital, use the average amount of hospital waste from the literature and NASA surface meteorology in addition to the solar energy database from HOMER Pro software to construct a hybrid model for a conceptual hospital in the new green city in Saudi Arabia, NEOM. The hybrid model consisted of biogas cofire and diesel generators, PV solar array and batteries. Simulations were performed to analyse the load requirements of a standalone hospital. The mechanism of energy storage was designed based on Tesla batteries. Then, the hybrid hospital model was tested with NEOM's natural resources, load demand of 250 kWh/day and the average amount of daily hospital waste of 0.6 tons based on the literature data. This condition allows the smart hospital to be tested with real features. The outcome of the COE, NPC and the amount of reduction of carbon dioxide in the hybrid hospital were analysed. Many of the hybrid properties and constraints that define the hospital were adopted from previous literature concentrating on similar domains. The optimal solution of a hybrid micro grid consisted of biogas cofire, PV array, and batteries. Of the total load demand, 32.3% and 67.6% were produced by PV array and biogas cofire generators, respectively, together with eight Tesla PowerWall2.0 batteries. The cost of energy was 0.21 USD/kWh and the net present cost was 243,699.17 USD. In this study, we compared renewable energy with conventional energy and found that the optimal solution would be able to reduce carbon emission and diesel consumption by almost 84% and 81%, respectively.

Additionally, this study also addresses the mediating role of satisfaction in the relationships between transportation service quality, and both attitude toward and image of a sustainable city, as well as the moderating role of involvement in the links between satisfaction and this attitude and between satisfaction and this image. The findings confirm that both core transportation service and the physical environment of transportation significantly and positively influence satisfaction and, in turn, significantly and positively influence attitude toward and image of a sustainable city. Satisfaction also plays a mediating role in the links between transportation service quality and this attitude and image. In addition, the effect of satisfaction on attitude toward and image of a sustainable city becomes greater as the level of involvement increases. © 2019 by the authors."

It is viewed as a natural step in operationalizing sustainable development within different societal spheres. As a holistic urban development strategy, smart sustainable cities represent a manifestation of sustainable development as a process of change and a strategic approach to achieving the long-term goals of sustainability. Achieving smart sustainable cities represents an instance of urban sustainability, a concept that refers to a desired state in which a city strives to retain the balance of socio-ecological system through sustainable development as a desired trajectory. This long-term goal requires fostering linkages between scientific and social research, technological innovations, institutional practices, and policy design and planning in relevance to urban sustainability. It also requires a long-term vision, a transdisciplinary approach, and a system-oriented perspective on addressing environmental, economic, and social issues. These requirements are at the core of backcasting as an approach to futures studies. Backcasting is a special kind of scenario methodology to develop future models for smart sustainable city as a planning tool for urban sustainability. Goal-oriented backcasting approaches declare long-range targets that lie quite far in the future. Visionary images of a long-term future can stimulate an accelerated movement towards achieving the goals of urban sustainability. The backcasting approach is found to be well-suited for long-term urban sustainability solutions due to its normative, goal-oriented, and problem-solving character. Also, it is particularly useful when dealing with complex problems and transitions, the current trends are part of the problem, and different directions of development can be allowed given the wide scope and long time horizon considered. A number of recent futures studies using backcasting have underlined the efficacy of this scholarly and planning approach in terms of indicating policy pathway for sustainability transitions and thus supporting policymakers and facilitating and guiding their actions. However, as there are a number of backcasting approaches used in different domains, and the backcasting framework is adaptive and contextual in nature, it is deemed highly relevant and useful to devise a scholarly and planning approach to strategic smart sustainable city development. This paper has a fourfold purpose. It aims (1) to provide a comparative account of the most commonly applied approaches in futures studies dealing with technology and sustainability (forecasting and backcasting); (2) to review the existing backcasting methodologies and discuss the relevance of their use in terms of their steps and guiding questions in analyzing strategic smart sustainable city development as an area that is at the intersection of city development, sustainable development, and technology development; (3) to synthesize a backcasting approach based on the outcome of the review and discussion; and (4) to examine backcasting as a scholarly methodology and planning approach by looking at its use in the Gothenburg 2050 Project, as well as to use this case to illustrate the core of the synthesized approach. The synthesized scholarly and planning approach serves to help researchers and scholars in analyzing strategic smart sustainable city development to assist planners, policymakers, and decision-makers in their endeavor to implement smart sustainable cities. © 2018, The Author(s)."

With the aim to maximize its long-term average transmission reward, almost all the existing optimal energy management strategies are based on the policy iteration algorithm, which suffers from the curse of dimensionality. By contrast, we focus on developing low-complexity optimal policies that can lead to practical implementation. Our main contribution is to propose a threshold-based scheduling policy for energy harvesting sensor networks achieving long-term average rewards. As a result, a sensor node only requires limited memory to store a few optimal value thresholds to perform energy management. Specifically, we propose an algorithm to compute the optimal thresholds, whose complexity is linear with the size of data and energy storage. Numerical results are studied based on real solar radiation data measured at Queensland and show that the optimal expected reward of our proposed scheduling policy approaches its theoretical offline upper bound. © 2005-2012 IEEE."

Malaysia’s government uses political machinery to pass policies on to local governments so that they can work on and manage them locally. However, the law is very important in changing people’s behaviors; therefore, the government must act rigorously and equitably so that Malaysia can soon develop clean and green cities. In addition, for long-term success, the government must focus on educating youth and students to make them aware of the clean and green concept. Maintaining a clean and green city will help with improving people’s health, preserving the environment, promoting tourism, attracting investors and companies, creating more employment opportunities, producing more public space for people, and imparting good qualities among individuals for future generations. © Common Ground Research Networks,."

The five growth coefficients of the SLEUTH (Slope, Land-use, Exclusion, Urban, Transport, Hillshade) cellular automaton model of land use change and urban growth are often seen as an operationalization of urban DNA. For both theoretical urban studies and applied urban modeling, it is important to further develop this concept by understanding whether main urban DNA classes relate to distinct outcomes in terms of livability and sustainability. This study initiates this line of research by gathering empirical evidence about urban DNA and livability-sustainability indicators across a global sample of cities. It produces a behavioral taxonomy of cities according to their urban DNA and performance in livability and sustainability indices and indicators, and attempts a further link with the concept of urban commons. The results show that, notwithstanding variation across cities, it is possible to distinguish six such types of cities with relatively distinct behaviors and performances: multinodal, dispersed cities, with mixed outcomes (type A); multinodal, contiguous, slow-growing (type B); transport-oriented, dispersed, fast-growing (type C); large, buzzy, constrained (type D); dense, contiguous, fast-growing (type E); and transport-oriented, contiguous, interactive (type F) cities. © 2019 Votsis and Haavisto."

However, will the societal agenda also influence the project management discipline? Societal issues generated by urban population growth and rapid urbanization arise in cities. Making a city “smart” and sustainable is emerging as a strategy to mitigate these issues. How does this development impact project management? In order to answer this question, we performed meaningful learning by mapping the concepts for Smart Sustainable Cities (SSC) and project management and developing prior and post concept maps. We identified four major findings describing the implication of societal issues on project management: quality of life acts as a societal objective for PM; PM governs autonomous projects with new business models; and PM success criteria are related to stakeholders and long-term effects, as well as extensive connection to the digital world with consideration of the privacy and ethics. From this, we were able to redefine the definition of project management as “a collaborative endeavor of all affected stakeholders equivalently participating in exploring and exploiting, via an autonomous temporary organization, fit-for-purpose deliverables with connections to the digital platform, thereby aiming to prepare the entities of the affected stakeholders for the future”. Our study is novel and relevant for PM and SSC practice: societal issues are on the strategy agenda of many governments and companies, and these will drive the projects that are performed in this environment. The project management community should align with this development, since these challenges are part of their environment.

This article questions the specificities of the concept against lessons drawn from the experiences of eco-and sustainable quarters being implemented in France and other places in Europe. The model for a Chinese eco-city is considered in the light of our study of the Tianjin eco-city, which is a Sino-Singaporean project half-way towards its intended completion in 2020. Our study was conducted on the spot within this eco-city, and it enables us to make a close examination of a number of its specific aspects and to raise questions, in a manner not yet fully researched in this area, as to how widely such an urban model might be diffused. Its implementation of a system of performance indicators, and its introduction of a structure of governance to support environmental protection, represent promising avenues for a paradigm change in Chinese urban planning. On the other hand, the bias in favour of technological solutions and the lack of concern with the residents' life styles are a matter for debate over the pertinence and sustainability of such a model for urban development. © All rights reserved."

The existing studies have started addressing waste management problems in smart cities mainly by focusing on the design of new sensor-based Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, and optimizing the routes for waste collection trucks with the aim of minimizing operational costs, energy consumption and transportation pollution emissions. In this study, the importance of value recovery from trash bins is highlighted. A stochastic optimization model based on chance-constrained programming is developed to optimize the planning of waste collection operations. The objective of the proposed optimization model is to minimize the total transportation cost while maximizing the recovery of value still embedded in waste bins. The value of collected waste is modeled as an uncertain parameter to reflect the uncertain value that can be recovered from each trash bin due to the uncertain condition and quality of waste. The application of the proposed model is shown by using a numerical example. The study opens new venues for incorporating the value recovery aspect into waste collection planning and development of new data acquisition technologies that enable municipalities to monitor the mix of recyclables embedded in individual trash bins. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd"

However, most are too complex, cannot measure green performance over time and fail to deliver actionable advice to decision-makers. The Green City Concept (GCC) is one of the latest of these concepts. This paper introduces a Green City Conceptual Framework (IHS-GCCF) and a harmonized method to measure Global Green City Performance over time (GGCPI). The IHS-GCCF highlights the importance of energy as a steward of resource efficiency and green performance. IHS-GCCF and GGCPI can be used to measure green performance, to explain possible factors influencing the calculated green performances over time, set targets and track achievements. They are adaptable to individual city needs. By applying the method to fifty cities worldwide through desk research, the paper shows that a green city is also sustainable and liveable. It also shows that GDP influences Green City Performances positively, population size influences it negatively and sanitation and air quality sectors influence green city performance the most. The paper addresses a range of gaps in the green city field. It consolidates prior research into one actionable conceptual framework and method. © 2018 by the authors."

Although several reviews have shed light on the effect of PM on human health, their critical adverse effect on material’s structure and sustainability was almost neglected. The current study is an attempt to fill this gap related to PM impact on structural materials under the overall consideration of sustainability. More specifically, this review highlights the existing knowledge by providing an overview on PM classification, composition, and sources in different locations around the world. Then, it focuses on PM soiling of surfaces such as solar panels due to an increasing need to mitigate the impact of soiling on reducing photovoltaic (PV) power output and financial competitiveness in dusty regions. This topic is of critical importance for sustainable deployment of solar energy in arid and desert areas around the world to help in reducing their impact on overall climate change and life quality. In addition, this review summarizes climate change phenomena driven by the increase of PM concentration in air such as radiative forcing and acid rain deposition due to their impact on human health, visibility and biodiversity. To this end, this work highlights the role of process management, choice of fuel, the implementation of clean technologies and urban vegetation as some possible sustainable mitigation policies to control PM pollution in cities and urban regions. This research is designed to conduct a comprehensive narrative literature review which targets broad spectrum of readers and new researchers in the field. Moreover, it provides a critical analysis highlighting the need to fill main research gaps in this domain. The findings of this review paper show that PM pollution imposes severe adverse impacts on materials, structures and climate which directly affect the sustainability of urban cities. The advantages of this review include the value of the extensive works that elaborate on the negative impacts of PM atmospheric pollution towards high level of public awareness, management flexibility, stakeholder’s involvements, and collaboration between academy, research, and industry to mitigate PM impact on materials and human welfare. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

This makes the available monitoring and evaluation tools difficult to adopt and apply in different urban contexts to support urban planning and governance and foster evidence-based policymaking. In order to address this issue, the paper brings together knowledge-based development concept with smart and sustainable cities. Knowledge-based development is a vision of development that considers knowledge as the central structuring element of a development strategy. Similarly, its more territory focused version, knowledge-based urban development is an integrated approach for the transition of cities and regions into sustainable, liveable and prosperous localities.

As a possible prototype for eco-cities, location, space, and oil influence distinguish the United Arab Emirates from a lot of countries. Masdar City’s structural design, solar energy techniques, and transportation plans, however, are features that can be modeled to build other eco-cities.

To this end, the article explores the innovation process of institutions, thereby bringing together areas of research on institutional entrepreneurship, innovation processes, and transformation. Our model interlinks invention, innovation and adoption of new institutions to achieve a new institutional logic for more sustainable development in a city. We introduce ‘workset’ as an interim step between action and practice and identify local adopters as key for diffusion. We illustrate our framework using a case study of urban institutional entrepreneurship in the socio-economic system of a German city. Our findings indicate that the roles of local institutional entrepreneurs and local adopters partly overlap, that worksets are crucial for broader diffusion of new institutions, and that a robust design supports the adoption of the institutional innovation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V."

Built on an integrative review of the literature, this study offers insights into the potential of smart cities and connected communities in facilitating waste management efforts. Shortcomings of existing waste management practices are highlighted and a conceptual framework for a centralized waste management system is proposed, where three interconnected elements are discussed: (1) an infrastructure for proper collection of product lifecycle data to facilitate full visibility throughout the entire lifespan of a product, (2) a set of new business models relied on product lifecycle data to prevent waste generation, and (3) an intelligent sensor-based infrastructure for proper upstream waste separation and on-time collection. The proposed framework highlights the value of product lifecycle data in reducing waste and enhancing waste recovery and the need for connecting waste management practices to the whole product life-cycle. An example of the use of tracking and data sharing technologies for investigating the waste management issues has been discussed. Finally, the success factors for implementing the proposed framework and some thoughts on future research directions have been discussed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd"

This paper ranks 28 European capital cities based on how smart and sustainable they are. Using hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis (PCA), we synthesized 32 indicators into 4 components and computed rank scores. The ranking of European capital cities was based on this rank score. Our results show that Berlin and other Nordic capital cities lead the ranking, while Sofia and Bucharest obtained the lowest rank scores, and are thus not yet on the path of being smart and sustainable. While our city rank scores show little correlation with city size and city population, there is a significant positive correlation with the cities’ GDP per inhabitant, which is an indicator for wealth. Lastly, we detect a geographical divide: 12 of the top 14 cities are Western European; 11 of the bottom 14 cities are Eastern European. These results will help cities understand where they stand vis-à-vis other cities, giving policy makers an opportunity to identify areas for improvement while leveraging areas of strength. © 2018 The Authors"

This transformation is often represented by a roadmap. Different approaches were introduced in the literature to assist in developing such a roadmap. However; a thorough analysis of these approaches shows none of them cover holistically all aspect of the SSCs. For instance, some roadmaps neglect analyzing the current challenges of a city. Others falls short in addressing one or more of the SSC six dimensions. None considers checking the city readiness for change. This constitutes a gap in knowledge that this research highlights and addresses through a sound theoretical foundation, specifically, by linking the Theory of Change to the SSC concept and introducing a theoretical logic model for the transformation towards SSCs. The latter is used to propose a coherent, systematic transformation roadmap that captures the cross-cutting readiness of a city along its infrastructures.

Fine dust level data are sufficiently local to make regional forecasting meaningless. Thus, this study proposes an alternative measurement technique to minimize differences between published and perceived levels of fine dusts. Owing to the large variations in the fine dust levels within urban areas, it is very difficult to provide measurements that are sufficiently area-representative. Because infants and elementary school students are more sensitive to fine dust than adults, it is useful to construct large data sets of measurements of fine dust levels at elementary schools. In Korea, the distribution of elementary schools is consistent with population density, which is useful for analyzing local differences in the fine dust levels in urban areas.

With the rapid development of cities and economy, urban traffic problems have become more and more serious, especially the problem of urban traffic congestion caused by commuter traffic. The law of commuting behavior in eco-city can directly reflect the spatial structure of the city. Exploring the interaction between eco-city commuting and occupational residence distribution is of great significance for alleviating urban traffic congestion and promoting urban development. Based on the big data of time and space commuting, the system develops the relationship between commuting traffic and occupational residence distribution in eco-city. The main work and achievements are as follows: (1) Analysis of population distribution. This paper visualizes the population distribution of ecological city commuting data at different spatial scales and time scales; (2) Analysis of commuting exchange situation. This paper visualizes the attendance traffic data of popular plots through dynamic O-D diagrams; (3) Crowd movement analysis. In this paper, the traffic data of the subway station’s traffic attendance of the popular block is visually analyzed through the dynamic chart, and the dynamic movement of the taxi trajectory during the early peak period is used to analyze the flow of the urban population; (4) This system takes the eco-city commuting as the research object, explores the distribution characteristics of eco-city commuting in urban space, thus realizing the urban occupational commuting analysis system that assists urban planning. The system breaks through the traditional “duty and residence balance” analysis method, and realizes the visual analysis of commuting data of eco-city in Chongqing and Beijing based on spatio-temporal big data, thus providing reference for urban planning, in order to assist the coordinated development of urban transportation planning and land use. © Foundation Environmental Protection & Research-FEPR."

Evaluating sustainable city logistics initiatives such as urban distribution centres, congestion pricing, delivery timing and access restrictions is a complex problem since several subjective and objective criteria and constraints should be taken into account. On the other hand, collaboration partner selection in the context of the city logistics planning plays an important role in achieving operational efﬁciency under municipal freight regulations such as access, sizing and timing restrictions. This study identifies and reviews the applied criteria/sub-criteria, and multi-criteria decision-making techniques for sustainable city logistics initiatives selection and also collaboration partner selection problems and presents an insight into common criteria/sub-criteria and suitable multi-criteria decision-making techniques for future researches. The results of this literature review reveals that the recent papers aim at considering simultaneously technical, social, environmental and economic criteria by using analytical hierarchy process (AHP) method in the selection of sustainable city logistics initiatives.

This article is an endeavor to talk about the key issues to build future urban cities and to redeveloping existing infrastructure in existing urban areas. Further, the article discusses the difficulties in financing smart city projects in India. The government of India, under the leadership of PM Mr. Narendra Modi, has propelled a strong eagerness with the Smart City Mission in 2015 which has the sole objective of giving a better quality of life to the citizens of the country. Steps are being initiated by government for the transformation of over 100 cities into smart future cities. The present nature of government silos will represent a noteworthy test in the execution of urban development projects. To motivate and attract the increased private sector participation and investment in infrastructure projects it would be beneficial if the government funding were linked to the effort of developing projects as PPP.

During its design process, a sound formal verification and a performance monitoring scheme are needed to check its reliability and meaningful quantitative properties. In this paper, we provide formal verification solutions for an ER-based system by proposing a continuous-time Markov chain model describing the architecture of the ER-based system. To verify real-world function of the ER-based system, we choose electricity trading to propose a Markov decision process model based on an ER subsystem to describe the trading behavior. To monitor the system performance, we project the energy scheduling process in the ER-based system, and then implement this scheduling process on top of a cloud computing experiment tool. Finally, we perform extensive experiment evaluations to investigate the system reliability properties, quantitative properties, and scheduling behaviors.

City logistics models can be effective in solving complicated problems such as traffic congestion, air pollution, accidents, and high energy consumption rate. The present paper proposes a bi-objective mathematical model for designing a city logistics distribution network in order to minimize the economic and environmental costs as well as the response time. The proposed model would make decisions on the location and allocation problems in the city logistics distribution network. In fact, the objective of the problem is to select some fixed sites in order to construct the city distribution centers. The demand for commodities is considered probabilistic and the network is modeled based on the queuing theory. Furthermore, in the proposed model, the policy of putting tax on carbon and applying the low-carbon emission resources are used for establishment at the city distribution centers. Afterwards, in order to validate the proposed model, a numerical example is generated and, then, the results obtained from solving the model via epsilon constraint method are presented. Analysis of the results in the present study indicates that the proposed model was highly efficient in achieving its objectives. Finally, there are some suggestions for future studies that can be taken into account. © 2018 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada."

However, Melaka faces several related sustainable issues such as traffic, public transportation, health problems and others that are big challenges for the Melaka state to implement a complete Green City Branding (GCB). This study was to examine the factors that influence Melaka state towards a complete GCB and to investigate strategies of Melaka state towards a complete GCB. A qualitative approach was utilized by conducting a case study at the Melaka Green Technology Corporation (MGTC) and a semi-structured in-depth interview session was done among fifteen executives to obtain the primary data. Thus, by preventing the Melaka state from being harmed, the benefits of embarking on a complete GCB may be beneficial to the social and economic well-being for the sake of current and future generations. Future studies should be focusing on the hurdles faced by the Melaka state government in implementing a complete GCB because the state government is serious in aiming for the Green City State status. © Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology."

SSTEC is reputed to be ""the first experiment to plan, build (sic) a new city in an ecological way.""2 This article examines the nature of Tianjin's claims to eco-city status and compares and contrasts some of its key performance indicator [KPI] goals and achievements. As a control, an outline of KPIs from Tianjin Eco-city are set against the environmental and sustainable criteria derived from London, chosen given the brevity of this article. This article is not an international comparison of Eco-city Frameworks between two eco-cities; rather, it is a comparative assessment between a large, historic, non-eco-prefixed city and one of the most high-profile, new Chinese eco-cities in the world. These cities are not comparable in scale, history, culture, industry or sociopolitical structure-that is one reason for their choice. This article does not consider whether one or the other city is better or more or less compliant, but is an attempt to understand whether the ""eco"" label itself has merit. If benchmarks for the urban environmental performance of a city are site specific, then are they meaningful benchmarks? If non-eco-cities comply with eco-criteria, then what does the prefix tell us? The intention is to begin a process that leads to better understanding of the eco-city phenomenon and to inquire as to whether referencing eco-city labels can provide a useful interpretative mechanism for urban strategic planning.3                          © 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc."

Based on the theoretical research and practice of eco-city, a discrete filtering method based on evidence theory was proposed to analyze the demand of supporting facilities for the elderly at home to improve the validity of the demand analysis of supporting facilities for the elderly at home. Firstly, the original indicators of the service quality evaluation of community pension institutions are constructed to realize the project inspection and reliability analysis of the data; Secondly, the cost function is designed for the dynamic characteristic model of the demand analysis for supporting facilities in the old-age community based on the likelihood estimation algorithm, it obtains the observation matrix of dynamic characteristics of demand analysis for supporting facilities in old-age community under the condition of discrete filtering, and achieves effective defense against noise interference. Then, a real experimental environment is established to analyze and track the needs of supporting facilities in the old-age community, and the influence of noise in the process of analyzing and locating the needs of supporting facilities in the old-age community is analyzed experimentally. The experimental results show that the algorithm designed in this paper has a higher accuracy than the locating and tracking algorithm for the needs analysis of the supporting facilities of the elderly community using the discrete filtering algorithm alone, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified. © Foundation Environmental Protection & Research-FEPR."

Housing is an important challenge and in many cities, therefore, a key stakeholder are social housing organisations. This paper introduces a qualitative case study of a social housing provider in the UK who implemented a business intelligence project (a method to assess data networks within an organisation) to increase data quality and data interoperability. Our analysis suggests that creating pathways for different information systems within an organisation to ‘talk to’ each other is the first step. Some of the issues during the project implementation include the lack of training and development, organisational reluctance to change, and the lack of a project plan. The challenges faced by the organisation during this project can be helpful for those implementing SSCs. Currently, many SSC frameworks and models exist, yet most seem to neglect localised challenges faced by the different stakeholders. This paper hopes to help bridge this gap in the SSC research agenda. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd"

As one of the prevalent ICT visions or computing paradigms, the IoT is associated with big data analytics, which is clearly on a penetrative path across many urban domains for optimizing energy efficiency and mitigating environmental effects. This pertains mainly to the effective utilization of natural resources, the intelligent management of infrastructures and facilities, and the enhanced delivery of services in support of the environment. As such, the IoT and related big data applications can play a key role in catalyzing and improving the process of environmentally sustainable development. However, topical studies tend to deal largely with the IoT and related big data applications in connection with economic growth and the quality of life in the realm of smart cities, and largely ignore their role in improving environmental sustainability in the context of smart sustainable cities of the future. In addition, several advanced technologies are being used in smart cities without making any contribution to environmental sustainability, and the strategies through which sustainable cities can be achieved fall short in considering advanced technologies. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to review and synthesize the relevant literature with the objective of identifying and discussing the state-of-the-art sensor-based big data applications enabled by the IoT for environmental sustainability and related data processing platforms and computing models in the context of smart sustainable cities of the future. Also, this paper identifies the key challenges pertaining to the IoT and big data analytics, as well as discusses some of the associated open issues. Furthermore, it explores the opportunity of augmenting the informational landscape of smart sustainable cities with big data applications to achieve the required level of environmental sustainability. In doing so, it proposes a framework which brings together a large number of previous studies on smart cities and sustainable cities, including research directed at a more conceptual, analytical, and overarching level, as well as research on specific technologies and their novel applications. The goal of this study suits a mix of two research approaches: topical literature review and thematic analysis. In terms of originality, no study has been conducted on the IoT and related big data applications in the context of smart sustainable cities, and this paper provides a basis for urban researchers to draw on this analytical framework in future research. The proposed framework, which can be replicated, tested, and evaluated in empirical research, will add additional depth to studies in the field of smart sustainable cities. This paper serves to inform urban planners, scholars, ICT experts, and other city stakeholders about the environmental benefits that can be gained from implementing smart sustainable city initiatives and projects on the basis of the IoT and related big data applications. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

Analyses of urban quality typically focus on applying methodologies that evaluate quality objectives at environmental, urban, and building levels. Research has shown that a system of indicators can be useful for developing qualitative and quantitative descriptors of urban environments. The first step in this study was to formulate a methodology to measure the quality of urban life based on investigative checklists and objective and subjective indicators, aggregated to develop an index to evaluate a city's level of smart urban quality. The second step was to apply this methodology to evaluate the city of Cagliari (Italy) at the neighbourhood scale, which is considered by literature the most suitable as a self-sufficient spatial unit for showing redevelopment results. In addition to sharing its research findings, this study aims to verify whether the methodology can be applied to similar urban contexts.

Therefore, it has started to develop various eco-cities, low-carbon cities, and other types of sustainable cities. The massive launch of these sustainable initiatives, as well as the higher cost of these projects, requires the Chinese government to invest large sums of money. What financial toolkits can be employed to fund this construction has become a critical issue. Against this backdrop, the authors have selected Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-city (SSTEC) and Shenzhen International Low-Carbon City (ILCC) and compared how they finance their construction. Both are thus far considered to be successful cases. The results show that the two cases differ from each other in two key aspects. First, ILCC has developed a model with less financial and other supports from the Chinese central government and foreign governments than SSTEC, and, hence, may be more valuable as a source of inspiration for other similar projects for which political support at the national level is not always available. Second, by issuing bonds in the international capital market, SSTEC singles itself out among various sustainable initiatives in China, while planning the village area as a whole and the metro plus property model are distinct practices in ILCC. In the end, the authors present a generic financing model that considers not only economic returns but also social and environmental impacts to facilitate future initiatives to finance in more structural ways. © 2018 by the authors."

Recently, new types of car sharing such as free-floating carsharing (FFCS) are surprisingly driving the growth of the carsharing markets in European and US cities and there is a need to estimate their spillover effects and study strategies to promote their use. This paper contributes to the existing literature with a holistic evaluation of the impacts generated by FFCS on user behaviour in a specific population: university students. The added value of this research is that it provides the first analysis of the impacts of a FFCS (Car2go) system in Spain, and includes a comparison with previous similar research in the city of Hamburg. The methodology was based on a survey campaign of students (186 valid questionnaires), validated with over 330 sequential observations of available cars on the university campus. The results clearly show how the quality attributes of FFCS depend strongly on car availability and on the limit time and distance tolerated by each user to wait and walk in search of a free car respectively. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd"

However, a town, to be considered sustainable, must, above all, be safe, particularly against natural hazards, which in Europe are mostly related to climate changes (e.g., hurricanes, floods, storms, and landslides) and seismic events (earthquakes). Unfortunately, sustainability is still not a prerogative of most European cities, especially those placed in seismic countries such as Italy, where at least 50% of the residential stock is earthquake-prone, while over 80% of the same stock is highly energy-consuming and carbon dioxide-emitting, thus contributing to trigger hazards related to climate changes. In this context, renovation actions, which combine both energy and seismic issues are strongly needed. Nevertheless, several technical, organizational and financial barriers considerably limit the real possibility to extensively undertake this kind of renovation. This study analyzes such barriers, with particular reference to the Italian scenario, suggesting and discussing possible solutions and underlining the advantages of increasing energy and seismic performances at the same time. The proposed solutions may be effectively extended to many other countries with similar socio-economic scenarios. © 2018 by the authors."

Its municipalities hope to attract investors, firms, high-quality labour force and residents in line with ecological modernization. They do so by using a variety of attractive city labels, such as eco city, low carbon city, and smart city. The physical shape these city labels take is best exemplified in the emergence of large new towns at the fringes of existing urban areas. Few studies to date unearth empirical evidence as to how municipal governments in China implement their smart eco city ambitions. This study does precisely that by examining how concrete policy networks at the local level develop new towns in the Pearl River Delta. The Policy Network Theory is used to map the positions actors have in three different new town projects in Shenzhen, Foshan, and Zhuhai respectively. It explains project progress or lack thereof by studying the organizational constellations that structure the interactions among actors and how the constellations affect their resources exchange. Our analysis suggests that in the various arenas where policy actors meet each other and are supposed to exchange resources and work out viable policy packages, blockades exist preventing such exchanges from happening.

"Energy and water as indicators for sustainable city site selection and design in Jordan using smart grid","2018","10.1016/j.scs.2017.10.037","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85034600217&doi=10.1016%2fj.scs.2017.10.037&partnerID=40&md5=8d7a4bb68de683be217cef855e31fcdb","The impending scarcity of the available natural resources can be addressed by streamlining sustainable energy sources. The investigation done in this work aimed at the selection of a location and design of a sustainable city in Jordan. The complexity of choosing a location arose due to the semiarid climate coupled with very limited conventional energy resources. In narrowing down the selection process, the authors developed a selection criterion for a sustainable city in Jordan. Based on that criterion, the north of King Hussein International Airport in Aqaba was determined to be the optimal location. This location has exceptional renewable energy resources and is close to the sea. The proposed sustainable city was designed to house 50,000 inhabitants and a total area of 11,128,508 m2. 26% of this area was used for renewable energy projects, 27.4% for housing, 16.1% area for agricultural use, 21.2% for public and green areas, and 9.3% for waste treatment and industrial zone. Smart grid was utilized to satisfy the energy needs for any sustainable site, which included energy management and storage. The electrical load of the proposed city was estimated based on the domestic and commercial electrical load of the city of Aqaba. The load has a peak of 24.78 MW and total energy consumption of 122.18 GWh. The city water demand was estimated, domestic water was stored in distributed tanks. A central 5873 m3 water storage tank was selected for emergency, agricultural, and other uses. Moreover, this tank served as energy storage medium. Since excess energy was used to desalinate water and the desalinated water was stored in this tank. Two-energy generation scenarios were studied, first, the use of CSP parabolic trough with thermal energy storage yielded an LCOE of 0.1697 USD/kWh. Second, the use of a hybrid, PV, and wind, the system with battery storage resulted in an LCOE 0.0748 USD/kWh for full load coverage. However, the LCOE in the city, if it were connected to the Jordanian national grid without battery storage, was estimated to be 0.0344 USD/kWh. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

However, without understanding the key activities of the eco-city, its success and subsequent benefits cannot be guaranteed. The objective of this paper is to identify critical success factors (CSFs) of eco-city and analyse the inter-relationship among them. To achieve this, 19 CSFs were identified through literature review and interviews. A questionnaire-based survey is then conducted to obtain opinions from professionals. The population of this study is 372 with 108 completed and valid questionnaires received. ‘Clear definition and targets’, ‘conflicting interests among stakeholders’, ‘residents’ behaviour and awareness of environment protection and energy conservation’ and ‘management in operation stage of eco-city’ were identified to be the most important factors. The five underlying CSF groupings included ‘governance’, ‘competence and behaviour of stakeholders’, ‘knowledge and market support’, ‘plan of the city’ and ‘external environment.’ The results showed the ranking of the CSFs and five underlying groupings. The findings serve not only to assist stakeholders of the eco-city to gain a better understanding of a successful development, but also serve as a useful reference for managers when adopting strategies in future for the development of eco-city projects. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

While certain environmental benefits of urban agriculture are evident, it is not clear what the optimal extent of urban agriculture would be in designing a sustainable city. Closing the loop by recycling waste products into new resources is fundamental to sustainability, but the extent to which this should occur at local, regional, or global scales is an open question. We analyze how potential benefits and costs associated with urban agriculture scale with the extent of implementation, and compare potential tradeoffs in different metrics of sustainability. We assess how the appropriate metrics to optimize in a given city are context-dependent. For example, maximizing production in a small land footprint could be important in densely developed urban environments, whereas filling vacant land with food-producing gardens may be a more appropriate goal in certain post-industrial cities. We assess the potential role that urban agriculture plays in making urban food systems more resilient to climate change and other disruptions. Finally, we consider a case study comparing the resources required and pollution generated to produce the lettuce supply of on U.S. metropolitan area through outdoor urban agriculture and indoor urban agriculture, compared to conventional production and cross-continental transportation.

Hardly, a couple of decades ago, application of electron beam (EB) technology has gained attention for waste management. When wastewater is irradiated with electron beam, the beam can alter the physico-chemical properties of irradiated aqueous material and also transform wastewater chemicals due to the excitation or ionization of chemical molecules. Thus, chemical reactions may be capable of producing new compounds. The beam of electrons initiates primary reactions to induce the excitation or ionization of molecules at varied rates. This review paper will help to a budding researcher how to optimize the irradiation process to achieve high efficiency with low electron beam energy which is economically viable/feasible.

In a radio-frequency-powered wireless communication system, sensors first harvest energy via the radio-frequency WPT, and then, transmit sensed data to the receiver. The 'harvest-then-transmit' protocol is used to coordinate the two operations, in which we wish to optimally decide when to harvest energy, when to transmit data, and what transmission rate should be used such that the data are maximally transmitted. Unlike existing works, we assumed that the wireless transferred power is dynamically changing, instead of being constant, which is more realistic in green smart city applications, e.g., Industry 4.0 workshop, smart transportation, and smart buildings, where environments are continuously changing, so the wireless transferred power is affected dynamically. In this paper, we present an optimal scheduling algorithm for the offline case where the varying WPT is known in advance. Based on the optimal principles learned from the offline case, we have designed an efficient online algorithm. Finally, we report our simulation results that demonstrate that our online scheduling algorithm can adaptively and efficiently achieve high data throughput. © 2005-2012 IEEE."

Most current research focuses on flagship projects and mega-cities, failing to disentangle the interactions between cross-scale actors and the dynamic patterns of institutional and social-techno innovations in rank-and-file cities. Applying sustainability transition theory and the Multi-level Perspective (MLP) framework, this paper takes Zhuhai's Western Central Eco New District (Town) as a case study to investigate the interactive relationships between various actors and institutional niches. Through intensive interviews with government officials, developers, professionals and local villagers, as well as an analysis of government planning and regulation archives, we argue that the interests of actors from different scales are split in the transition process and may pose a threat to the reconfiguration of the niche-regime dynamics. This may lead to a dilemma in the sustainability transition of new towns. Institutional fragmentation from lower scales might be another obstacle for the transition management and niche development of the eco new town. © 2018"

In general, the problems in Malang are similar to those in other big cities in Indonesia. Although urbanization is especially important for economic growth, it results in the degradation of environmental quality and promotes flooding, congestion, urban infrastructure problems, and slums. The tendency of the built-up area of Malang to increase faster, along with the population growth and development expansion, indicates that the city will surpass the region's holding capacity sooner than it should. Such conditions create an uncomfortable living environment. One way to make the city more comfortable, safe and in harmony with nature is to apply the green city (GC) concept. The purpose of this study is to analyse and evaluate the implementation of the GC concept in Malang. This research employs the gap analysis method, which compares the ideal GC conditions with the actual conditions in Malang.

There are clear advantages, which can be almost assured: autonomous vehicles will be more comfortable, the number of road accidents will be decreased, more people will gain access to the passenger car's benefits, and unimaginable traffic and business services will be created. Just because of these benefits, it is worth investing considerable resources in the development of autonomous vehicles. There are other expected positive impacts, such as wide-range vehicle sharing and congestion alleviation. However, these latter impacts are not self-explanatory, and research should be taken to ensure that the widespread use of autonomous vehicles results more sustainable urban transport. In this paper, we analyse the impact of autonomous vehicles on congestion. Firstly, we introduce the traffic operation of the road network with recurrent congestion. Secondly, we show that shared use of vehicles reduces congestion only if the sharing of family-owned vehicles is dominant. Otherwise, the users are likely to be mainly former public transport users, cyclists, and pedestrians. Thirdly, we demonstrate that the widespread use of autonomous vehicles reduces congestion only when the new technology improves the capacity of the key cross-section of the network. The capacity of these key cross-sections can only be slightly improved without major construction work, so congestion can only be reduced if there are significantly less vehicles on the road network or the efficiency of traffic flow through autonomous vehicles increases. However, the latter, according to our calculation, is not so favourable to bring about a fundamental improvement in the traffic because of the expected increase in the motorization. Finally, we present some proposals that can contribute to the reduction of congestion on the urban road networks dominated by autonomous vehicles. © 2019 WIT Press"

The construction of the E-GIS DB comprises: (a) collection of urban planning data, (b) consolidation of the urban space data into a single layer and creation of an overlaying 200 m × 200 m mesh in the area of interest, (c) calculation of building contents (use, scale, and structure/material), land use/cover, and altitude, and (d) derivation of a representative value for each factor in the mesh unit, and distribution of attributes across the area of interest. Based on the E-GIS DB, we considered one baseline and 22 alternative urban planning scenarios across the three stages of zoning plan, land use plan, and district unit plan, which exhibit variations in building scale and land cover. Statistical analysis shows that the environmental planning factors in the E-GIS DB (especially urban density) differ significantly between the three planning stages. Considering the precision of environmental and energy predictions, the construction of an E-GIS DB is recommended at district unit plan, land use plan, and zoning plan stages, in that order. The district unit planning stage is the most appropriate because it is closest to the realization of the urban development plan. The urban scenarios are assigned to three representative categories based on environmental and energy use characteristics: (a) scenarios with unacceptably high urban air temperature and energy use, (b) optimal scenarios, which exhibit the best cooling effect and low energy use, and (c) sub-optimal scenarios that must either be improved to achieve optimum environmental and energy outcomes, or else be replaced with an alternative scenario from group (b). When more optimal scenarios (recommended group for improved environmental performance and lower energy use) were applied, lower bound of FAR for building complexes was formed and eco-friendly land coverage such as soil and green cover was increased by 150% and 170%, respectively, which induced and urban cooling effect and resulted in energy savings. Subsequently, urban air temperature and total daily energy demand on the hottest summer day was lowered by 1.5 °C and approximately 100 W/m2 compared to the most unacceptable scenario. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd"

On a physical level, this paradigm is characterized by deploying a substantial number of different devices that can sense their surroundings and generate a large amount of data. The most typical case is image and video acquisition sensors. Recently, these types of sensors are found in abundance in urban spaces and are responsible for producing a large volume of multimedia data. The advanced computer vision methods for this type of multimedia information means that many aspects can be dynamically monitored, which can help implement value-added applications in the city. However, obtaining more elaborate semantic information from these data poses significant challenges related to a large amount of data generated and the processing capabilities required. This paper aims to address these issues by using a combination of cloud computing technologies and mobile computing techniques to design a three-layer distributed architecture for intensive urban computing. The approach consists of distributing the processing tasks among a city's multimedia acquisition devices, a middle computing layer, known as a cloudlet, and a cloud-computing infrastructure. As a result, each part of the architecture can now focus on a small number of tasks for which they are specially designed, and data transmission communication needs are significantly reduced. To this end, the cloud server can hold and centralize the multimedia analysis of the processed results from the lower layers. Finally, a case study on smart lighting is described to illustrate the benefits of using the proposed model in smart city environments. © 2013 IEEE."

Our survival and well-being depend on social interactions. However, the excessive comforts offered by cities can be counterproductive to our health. This paper aims to identify the cognitive effects derived from the regular practice of physical activity (PA), as well as the opportunities and characteristics present in cities to enhance this activity and the pedagogical implications that can be extracted from it. Sustainable cities must achieve their ecological goals through economic development that meets the present needs without compromising the quality of the future. Reports reveal that the widespread lack of PA is a major risk factor for both physical and mental health. The literature provides more and more evidence of how physical exercise affects the brain and cognition, and informs us of how and when we perform our daily PA. An analysis of the situation reveals the need to plan an urbanism committed to the promotion of PA accompanied by an analysis of the characteristics of urban spaces demanded by citizens and a necessary programming of recreational and educational activities that encourage the practice of physical exercise. © 2018 by the authors."

The “Blue-Green City” concept provides a viable framework for putting this into practice. Ningbo, is a coastal city with high flood risk, whose history as a Chinese “water town” demonstrates that approaches to water management implicit to the “Blue-Green” concept were practiced in ancient times, and lessons can be learned from these applications. Furthermore, recent launch of the “Sponge City” campaign by China's National Government demonstrates the political will to implement sustainable flood and water management in ways consistent with the “Blue-Green” ideals. Selection of Ningbo for a pilot project presents the opportunity to integrate new “Sponge city” approaches with ancient “Blue-Green” principles, within the contexts of both new urban development and retrofit.

The fast growing Jimma City in Ethiopia requires up-to-date waste quantification and characterization data for the planning and implementation of sound waste management options such as composting and energy recovery that could create new jobs and promote private sector involvement. Therefore, we quantified, characterized and evaluated energy potential and nutrient value of household solid waste from Jimma City. Total daily waste generated from the city's households was estimated to be 85.8 tons, with an average per capita generation rate of 0.56 ± 0.17 kg/day. The biodegradable organic waste comprises 76% by weight and had optimum moisture content and carbon to nitrogen ratio for composting. The energy content of combustible household waste was estimated to be 17.5 MJ/kg for gross heating value and 9.54 MJ/kg for the net heating value that surpasses the lower limit for thermal treatment process to be economically viable. Waste-to-energy conversion of combustible waste of cities could reduce annually about 25,303 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent greenhouse gas emissions. Char briquettes produced through pyrolysis of solid waste could be a potential substitute for firewood to prevent deforestation and indoor air pollution. In conclusion, composting and pyrolysis are sound waste management options for green cities development in developing countries while minimizing public health risks and cost of treatment and disposal. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

"A foundational framework for smart sustainable city development: Theoretical, disciplinary, and discursive dimensions and their synergies","2018","10.1016/j.scs.2017.12.032","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85042453610&doi=10.1016%2fj.scs.2017.12.032&partnerID=40&md5=8fca9980c63a16c84cb1f4fc298245ce","In the subject of smart sustainable cities, the underlying theories are a foundation for practice. Moreover, scholarly research in the field of smart sustainable cities operates out of the understanding that advances in the underlying knowledge necessitate pursuing multifaceted questions that can only be resolved from the vantage point of interdisciplinarity or transdisciplinarity. Indeed, research problems in this field are inherently too complex to be addressed by single disciplines. The PhD study addressing the topic of smart sustainable city development falls within the broad research field of sustainability transition and sustainability science where ICT is seen as a salient factor given its transformational, disruptive, and synergetic effects as an enabling, integrative, and constitutive technology. In light of this, the approach to the PhD study is of an applied theoretical kind, and its aim is to investigate and analyze how to advance and sustain the contribution of sustainable urban forms to the goals of sustainable development with support of ICT of pervasive computing. This is to primarily create a framework for strategic smart sustainable city development based on scientific principles, theories, and academic disciplines and discourses used to guide urban actors in their practice towards sustainability and analyze its impact. This involves the application of a set of integrative foundational elements drawn from urban planning, urban design, sustainability, sustainable development, sustainability science, data science, computer science, complexity science, systems theory, systems thinking, and ICT. Accordingly, it is deemed of high significance to devise a multidimensional framework consisting of relevant theories and academic disciplines and discourses that underpin the development of smart sustainable cities as a set of future practices. This framework in turn emphasizes the interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary nature and orientation of the topic of smart sustainable cities and thus the relevance of pursuing an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approach into studying this topic. Therefore, this paper endeavors to systematize the very complex and dense scientific area of smart sustainable cities in terms of identifying, distilling, and structuring the core dimensions of a foundational framework for smart sustainable city development as a set of future practices. In doing so, it focuses on a number of fundamental theories along with academic disciplines and discourses, with the aim of setting a framework that analytically relates city development, sustainability, and ICT, while emphasizing how and to what extent sustainability and ICT have particularly become influential in city development in modern society. In addition, this paper offers an in–depth interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary discussion covering topics of high relevance to the PhD study and at the heart of the very synergic relationship between the theoretical, disciplinary, and discursive dimensions of the foundational framework underpinning smart sustainable city development. These dimensions thus form the basis for the framework for strategic smart sustainable city development that is under investigation and will be developed based on a backcasting approach to strategic planning. This study provides an important lens through which to understand a set of influential theories and established academic disciplines and discourses with high potential for integration, fusion, and practicality in relation to the practice of smart sustainable city development. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

Asia in particular has witnessed notable developments, characterized by strong governmental intervention and national initiatives to create model eco-cities. In Japan, the central government launched an “Eco-Model Cities” program in 2008 and has designated twenty-three model cities. In China, hundreds of municipalities have pursued plans to become an eco- or low-carbon city following the government's demonstration projects. Across East Asia, the eco-city is promoted as an innovative urban policy capable of advancing the agendas of sustainable urbanization and the realignment of the post-industrial urban economy. This paper compares the policies and strategies of developing eco-cities in Japan and China using Kitakyushu and Tianjin Eco-city as case studies. It examines these cities’ common and contrasting approaches to ecological urbanism, their respective technological and urban design strategies, the relationship between eco-city building and local economic development, and the roles played by different stakeholders in this effort. The research focuses on their Key Performance Indicator systems and the spatial qualities they anticipate, which reflect fundamentally different ideas about what societal role an eco-city should best play. The comparative method sheds light on debates around important aspects of planning and managing an eco-city––namely, between new town and retrofit development, between top-down directive and bottom-up force, and between the eco-city as technology and as culture. This paper thus offers critical insight into the changing notions of urbanity within Asian society. © 2018 Elsevier B.V."

The investigation refers to the city of Rome and considers an environmental-friendly crowdshipping based on the use of the mass transit network of the city, where customers/crowdshippers pick-up/drop-off goods in automated parcel lockers located either inside the transit stations or in their surroundings. Crowdshippers are passengers that would use the transit network anyhow for other activities (e.g., home-to-work), thus avoiding additional trips. The study requires firstly, estimating the willingness to buy a crowdshipping service like the one proposed here, in order to quantify the potential demand. The estimation is realized adopting an extensive stated preference survey and discrete choice modeling. Then, several scenarios with different features of the service are proposed and evaluated up to 2025 in terms of both externalities (local and global pollutant emissions, noise emissions and accidents reductions) and revenues. The results are useful to understand and quantify the potential of this strategy for last mile B2C deliveries. Moreover, it provides local policy-makers and freight companies with a good knowledge base for the future development of a platform for public transport-based crowdshipping and for estimating the likely impact the system could have both from an economic and environmental point of view. © 2018 by the authors."

It uses participant observation and extant data to show how environmentalist statecraft provided ideological cover for a type of neo-Keynesian logistics growth regime that used infrastructure spending to stimulate the economy without addressing underlying issues of racial, economic, and environmental justice. Urban political ecology and racial capitalism are used as theoretical frameworks to stretch the boundaries of how sustainability is conceptualized and to challenge assumptions behind a green capitalism framework. Finally, the article examines how labor and environmental justice activists used what Sze et al. (2009, 836) called “cultural and ecological discourses” to challenge the green capitalist agenda by incorporating subaltern spatial imaginaries. © 2018 by American Association of Geographers."

We then identify the aspects of privacy and cybersecurity in AVs that are important for smart and sustainable development. Lastly, we review the efforts taken by federal governments in the US, the UK, China, Australia, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Germany, France, and the EU, and by US state governments to address AV-related privacy and cybersecurity risks in-depth. Overall, the actions taken by governments to address privacy risks are mainly in the form of regulations or voluntary guidelines. To address cybersecurity risks, governments have mostly resorted to regulations that are not specific to AVs and are conducting research and fostering research collaborations with the private sector. © 2018 by the authors.

To make green cities a reality, an ever expanding and evolving vehicular heterogeneous network infrastructure is required to enable fine-granularity data collection and reliable service delivery. In this paper, we investigate how to realize energy-efficient vehicular heterogeneous networks for green cities by exploring cooperative two-hop device-to-device-based vehicle-to-vehicle (D2D-V2V) transmission. We propose a two-stage energy-efficient resource allocation algorithm. In the first stage, an auction-matching-based joint relay selection, spectrum allocation, and power control algorithm is derived, which employs an English-auction approach for matching preference updating and conflict avoidance, and optimizes the energy efficiency of two-hop D2D-V2V and cellular links simultaneously in an iterative fashion. In the second stage, a nonlinear fractional programming based power control algorithm is developed to maximize the energy efficiency of the base station. Theoretical properties in terms of convergence, stability, and complexity are analyzed. Finally, the proposed algorithm is evaluated based on real-world road topology and realistic vehicular traffic. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves superior performance in terms of energy efficiency and network coverage compared to other heuristic algorithms. © 2005-2012 IEEE."

This contribution presents a methodology for “multi-criteria assessment of environmental concerns” to support the evaluation of space-related strategic visions. The city of Dresden serves as a case study area because the official landscape plan is based on this progressive strategic vision. The presented approach combines geostatistical methods (landscape structure metrics, spatial multi-criteria assessment, weighting approaches) and a multitude of data related to environmental concerns. Based on the multi-criteria assessment, an index of landscape functions was calculated, and the ecological network can be differentiated in many aspects by adding environmental concerns. Based on the results, areas with multiple landscape functions can be indicated and areas with a need for action or with potential can be identified in the city area. The use of the insights in urban and environmental planning for densification, in the landscape plan or in comparable planning documents as well as in the concrete area-related planning (neighbourhood scale) can support efforts for compact green cities and prevention of urban sprawl. Moreover beyond the aspect of justification and modification of strategic visions, the methodology presented also offers the potential to provide a basis for newly developing space-related visions and to carry out a multi-criteria assessment of green and open spaces in the context of qualitative densification. © 2018"

This article attends to this gap by demonstrating how sustainable lifestyles are understood in one of the world's “greenest” cities: Copenhagen (DK). On the basis of ethnographic field research with local policy-makers and sustainability-oriented community groups, I found that a dominant theme reflects Copenhagen's green city policy goals, as it envisions a techno-moral, energy-efficient citizen. Three contradictions were evident in this imaginary: privilege (class), suburbanites (scale), and disincentivizing (measurement). I give examples of how this green city citizen imaginary is inserted in policy, which demonstrates a disjuncture between how sustainable lifestyles are understood in practice and theory. This study empirically contributes to the ambiguous concept of sustainable lifestyles, while shedding light on potential social tensions of technocentric green city policy. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment"

Shenzhen International Low Carbon City (ILCC) is a demonstration project of the China-EU Partnership on Sustainable Urbanization (CEUPSU) and an intriguing example for understanding innovative forms of funding with the specific aim to do this in environmentally, socially and economically sustainable ways. This article examines which financial vehicles are utilized in ILCC, in what way these contribute to sustainability and which implications the lessons drawn from it have for other eco and low carbon cities in China and elsewhere. The authors find that Urban Investment and Finance Platforms and Public-Private-Partnerships (PPPs) in a broader context are the two financial vehicles ILCC uses. A broad approach to PPPs is chosen in which stakeholder involvement is key and social conflicts are avoided by balancing the interests of various stakeholders. In particular, planning the village area as a whole and arranging finance through ‘metro + property’ provide a replicable and operable example for other cities in funding urban renewal and community transformation and dealing with the issue how residents can share the benefits of urban development with developers. The combination of these financial arrangements facilitates ILCC to achieve the triple bottom line in sustainable urbanization. ILCC is environmentally sustainable by promoting low carbon transition, socially sustainable through resident and villager involvement, and financially sustainable through diversification of funding sources. The financing experience gained from ILCC provides practical lessons for other cities and has significant implications in adapting institutional and organizational arrangements to create enabling conditions for innovative financing activities. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd"

However, in compact cities, it has been shown that a low proportion of green spaces jeopardizes the sufficient supply of urban ecosystem services. This suggests that there remains a deficiency in clear visions for operationalizing compact and green cities. To remediate this, this paper introduces a systemic conceptual framework for compact and green cities by combining the concepts of smart growth and green infrastructure. The indicator-based, smart-compact-green city framework includes two aspects: 1) smart compact cities (considering the need to limit urban sprawl through smart growth) and 2) smart green cities (reflecting the preservation and (re-)development of urban green infrastructure). The paper suggests that there is the need to balance these two aspects to develop a systemic approach towards smart-compact-green cities. A hierarchical target system grounded on four characters for smart compact and smart green cities is developed. Smart-compact-green cities can be characterized through a 1) smart environment of compact and green cities, 2) smart multifunctionality of compact and green cities (economic, social, environmental), 3) smart government for compact and green cities and 4) smart governance for compact and green cities. The characters comprise twelve factors defined by 39 indicators for smart compact cities and 44 indicators for smart green cities, respectively. The systemic framework can support researchers and practitioners to develop visions of how existing or future cities can approach smart-compact-green cities in mainstreaming the ecology of and for cities by better understanding the complexity of urban systems and providing a basis for a systematic spatial monitoring. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

When occupying only 3% of Earth's land, they are both the engines of economic growth with 80% of the global GDP but at the same time cities are emitting 75% of global green house gases. The aim of this paper was to focus on how different city development programs have been developing and how they are supporting the city's strategic goals. This paper has shown self-assessment results of 37 projects from four different programs in the city of Tampere. The projects were evaluated against five themes: people, planet, propagation, governance and scalability/replicability. The results showed that the environmental indicators had high scores. Also, the governance focus had a high scores in most of the projects. The people focus was highest in project themes on smart cities. Some of the ecological projects were in nature very technical, which is the reason why they did not score that high in people theme. The results showed clearly that the scalability and replicability are becoming very important elements in the existing and coming projects in cities. This could be also clearly seen in the analyses where the scalability and replicability of the different projects has been important in last 5-10 years and it seem that especially in the recent years the importance has a high impact. From our study we could initially conclude that the program based approach in city's economic development seems to provide one strand of continuation in implementation of the city's economic development policy and that the impact of its implementation improves. The hierarchical roles of different sets of projects as well as that of the sub-ecosystems that have carried out the project(s) indicates that the ecosystem approach is a useful one. The results also highllighted the role of programs as platforms for for innovation and co-creation between citizens, companies, research organizations and public sector. In these ecosystems value is created to all stakeholders. The value may be direct financial value but may well be also indirect such as R&D related, community value etc. The role of the cities is very important in this ecosystem value creation as they are considered to be a neutral body with focus on the public interest, not a vested one. As the role of cities is growing to be paramount also in innovation, this should be reflected in regional, national and EU level innovation policies, funding schemes and regulations as well as in execution of innovations. © 2018 Firenze University Press."

Eco-city development has also raised similar concerns. This research was conducted in order to address such problems. Specifically, this paper develops a new sustainability index that emphasizes environmental justice for the purpose of better classifying and assessing eco-cities. The proposed index measures equity among places as a result of eco-city development. Specifically, this index indicates instances in which a certain location achieves sustainability through means detrimental to another location. Thus, the index, comprised of environmental, economic, and social indicators of sustainability, may also be used to foster justice among diverse locations (urban centers, suburbs, rural areas, and neighboring cities) by highlighting the genuine motives behind eco-city development. One preliminary finding from the application of this classification is that oftentimes, eco-city development is not completed in the environmental, economic, or social interests of the people. Official eco-cities tend to serve government officials’ interest in upper mobility. Developer eco-cities tend to be commercial expansions or developments focused on growth, profit, and model demonstration. Both official and developer eco-cities degrade the environment. They are also likely to develop urban centers at the environmental expense of other places. The economic growth of official and developer eco-cities is accompanied by worsening income inequality and social injustice. As a result, these types of eco-cities fail the sustainability performance assessment. Conversely, eco-cities founded by the citizens or by donors tend to focus on social and economic equity. This study was completed using qualitative research methods, including field work in 29 eco-cities throughout China and various countries. This field work was conducted from 2006 to 2014. Data was collected through interviews with 87 government officials, as well as environmental experts, grassroots environmentalists, residents, and real estate developers. The findings reveal that the majority of Chinese eco-cities have been overlooked in global eco-city literature. The research also calls for effective sustainability management in order to avoid the development of eco-cities that negatively impact the environmental and social interests of surrounding areas. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

Among these supposedly experimental models, the smart city and the eco-city stand out in terms of geographical diffusion, and are hailed by their advocates as the mark of an innovative urbanism based on a scientific approach to urban development. Through the analysis of Hong Kong and Masdar City, examples of a smart-city agenda and an eco-city project respectively, this paper questions the sustainability of so-called smart cities and eco-cities, by investigating the extent to which they are developed in a controlled and systematic manner as their developers claim. More specifically, the paper counterclaims mainstream understandings of smart and ecological urbanism, arguing that what are promoted as cohesive settlements shaped by a homogeneous vision of the sustainable city, are actually fragmented cities made of disconnected and often incongruous pieces of urban fabric. Theoretically, these claims are discussed through the concept of Frankenstein urbanism which draws upon Mary Shelley’s novel as a metaphor for unsuccessful experiments generated by the forced union of different, incompatible elements. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017."

Now, more than 50% of the world’s 7.5 billion humans live in cities. This change has often induced the degradation of environmental quality in urban areas. As a consequence, management policies are now fostering the ‘return of nature’ in cities, which, in turn, is requiring a better understanding of the ecology of urban environments. In particular, there is a need for a better knowledge on soil management because soils provide many functions in cities such as urban agriculture. Optimizing the diversity of soil-living organisms is essential to many environmental functions such as water depollution, biochemical cycles, fertility and carbon storage. However, few studies on the biological quality of urban soils have been performed so far. This article reviews actual knowledge on soil biological quality for urban management. The definition of urban soils is discussed, and we present services provided by soils. We also review modern methods and techniques to assess the biological quality of urban soils. Last, we suggest communication means to improve the consideration of soil quality in urban planning policies aimed at sustainable cities. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature."

It is also noteworthy point that energy crisis is a serious issue in the vast majority of the developing countries like India. A conceivable reason is that, the diminishing level of regular energy sources and the lack of initiatives for introducing the alternative sources of energy. Besides, the wasteful and illicit method for utilising energy adds to the various problems related to the energy crisis. It gives the idea that the expanding measure of unapproved battery worked vehicles and their unlawful method for utilising electricity is one of the fundamental reasons of energy deficit in the various states of the nation. Battery operated electric e-rickshaws have recently emerged in the public road transport sector in India. This study deals with the present situation of the e-rickshaws and electricity alternatives for their usage in India.

When Shenzhen is developing an international low carbon eco-city in the Ping Di, noise attenuation is a key factor to be considered in the design. Currently, Ping Di is not well developed with a low density and less streets. It is quieter than the well-developed areas such as Lou Hu, Fu Tian. However, after development, the situation would be changed if noise attenuation issues were not considered. This study is then to explore using noise-mapping technique to reduce possibly occurred noises and reach an ecological development goal. Based on noise-mapping analyses, noise levels of the Ping Di have been calculated and compared between the present and the design. It is found that the noise level according to the design is much higher than the present. In order to solve noise problems, attenuation measures were explored. Eventually, design guidelines for noise attenuation were proposed."

However, how to allocate the limited caching resources with secure content delivery becomes a new challenge. Therefore, in this paper, we present a novel theoretical model to deliver secure content with edge nodes in order to save energy for green cities. First, we present a reverse auction game to encourage edge nodes to cooperatively provide caching services with incentives. With the model, mobile users can determine the candidate of edge node to cache content based on the interaction between mobile users and edge nodes. Second, a trust management method is designed to evaluate the reliability of the selected candidate of edge node by considering the direct trust evaluation. Finally, extensive simulations show that the proposal can save energy with a secure content delivery where both the delay to obtain the content and the caching ratio can be improved compared with the conventional methods. © 2005-2012 IEEE."

Geographic information system, Pb isotope assessment, multivariate statistical analysis (principal component analysis, PCA), the geoaccumulation index (Igeo), potential ecological risk index (PERI), and a health risk assessment model were used to study the degree of pollution, identify sources of pollution, and assess the health risks to children and adults via three pathways (hand-mouth intake, skin contact, and respiration). The results show that the high traffic volume and exhaust gas emissions have led to high concentrations of heavy metals. The Igeo and PERI values of Cd (0.38-2.0 and 108-4531, respectively), indicating the present high pollution level and potential risk, respectively, varied the most. Pb isotope and PCA showed that Pb, Zn, and Cd from atmospheric deposition come from power plants and traffic-Cu is related to traffic, and Ni and Cr come mainly from soil particles (natural source).

This rapid increase in people will occur in developing countries (e.g., Saudi Arabia, China, India). Thus, complex issues related to an increasing level of urbanization present huge challenges but also huge opportunities for governments, societies, and businesses. For instance, sustainable cities projects can provide enormous opportunities with which to create better futures for larger numbers of people via the environmental greening of buildings, supply chains, energy, technology, transport, and waste management, as well as providing a wide range of economic and social benefits. Based on the literature review, this paper presents a research model that defines the unique roles that business firms play in building highly sustainable cities that thrive based on the triple bottom lines of economic, environmental, and social dimensions to create win-win situation. First, effective private and public partnerships are discussed in the context of sustainable cities. Second, the paper argues that enhancing and promoting sustainability strategies and practices in a city gives a firm a competitive advantage in both strategy and operations levels, making it a great role for the businesses. Third, the specific roles of businesses that link them between government entities and city residents will be discussed. Additionally, we have developed a measurement tool for measuring the success factors of these sustainable cities projects. This measurement tool aims to examine the changing roles of businesses in making urbanization sustainable in terms of economic sustainability (e.g., financial performance, job creation, and human resources development), social responsibility (e.g., Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) indicators), and sustainable environmental terms (e.g., quality of life, and resources efficiency use (recycling, renewable energy use)).

New mobility technologies in the transport sector such as electric vehicles (EV) can reduce these emissions substantially. However, a growing number of EV equipped with lithium-based traction batteries will most likely require large quantities of materials such as lithium. Associated with increasing amounts of EV batteries in use is the issue of handling obsolete batteries at the end of their lifetime. Recycling of End-of-Life-batteries is vital to cope with a rising demand for battery materials in terms of energy and resource savings as well as securing raw material supply. But, the recovery of valuable materials during battery recycling processes is a matter of costs. Here we assess the possibilities and conditions for lithium recycling from retired EV batteries in a prospective manner by applying dynamic material flow analysis to the global lithium cycle. In this regard, we also evaluate how potential trends in future raw material prices may impact lithium recycling. We found out that only with a strong price increase for primary lithium, the recovery of lithium from battery recycling processes will become competitive within the next ten years. This underlines the need for strategies to improve the cost-efficiency of lithium recycling. In this context, we discuss options to promote the profitability of lithium recycling from EV batteries, focusing on cities since there are incentives for an increasing use of EV such as emission reductions and infrastructures for a widespread adoption of electric mobility in urban traffic as well. Furthermore, cities provide opportunities for battery use beyond EV through the combined development of decentralized renewable energy sources and smart grids.  © EDP Sciences, 2018."

However, existing research does not provide a clear picture of how this smart city agenda actually contributes to sustainability. The social science literature has been critical toward urban smartness, with most of the empirical research focusing on the politics of data-driven and entrepreneurial urbanism. This article seeks to contribute to this debate by empirically examining the role that sustainability plays in the smart city discourse. Its distinctive approach is to investigate how urban smartness and sustainability are framed by an authoritative institution (the European Union) and then to trace these framings down to a particular city (Stavanger, Norway). The data show that the smartness approach is strongly tied to innovation, technology, and economic entrepreneurialism, and sustainability does not appear to be a very important motivating driver. Nevertheless, the ‘sustainability component’ of the smart city agenda becomes clearer the closer we come to the city level. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

In contrast with developed countries, where urban regeneration is seen as a renewal and adjustment to new trends, in developing countries it presents an opportunity to start from scratch. Aside from the pressing social-economic issues, several authors identify critical aspects in these informal settlements, these including: they are usually the only viable solution to transform the lives of the poorest in a meaningful and cost-effective way; and improvised solutions are within context and can use local resources and thus promote a more sustainable outcome. Thus, cities in developing countries can become a paradigm for urban development. This paper develops and discusses research on urban regeneration for developing countries based on the transformation of the informal into formal, within the framework of the sustainable city. A model to enable this transformation is presented. This model is designed at several scales, from policy to the actual physical transformation of the urban environment, creating a sequential process from concept to the implementation. The methodology combines a theoretical and empirical approach through the analysis of case studies and practical implementation. Public and private sector roles and actions are clearly defined and their physical results presented.

However, the performance of eco and low-carbon cities in China has long been heatedly debated, with many negative arguments delineating them as profit-seeking and image-building projects simply capped with impressive names. In reality, while some projects have not fulfilled expectations, most are still at the first stage of construction, so it is too early to regard eco and low-carbon cities as a failure. In this paper, the question of how eco and low-carbon new towns differ from conventional ones in their social, environmental and economic characteristics is posed. Compared to conventional new town plans, the eco and low-carbon city plans incorporate more of a focus on sustainability principles. We examine such perceptions by comparing the master plans of eco, low-carbon and conventional new towns in various aspects ranging from general principles to specific design. The analysis indicates the master plans of the three groups of new towns vary in different ways. The eco-cities and low-carbon cities reflect two trends to promote urban sustainability. The eco new towns are more concerned with the promotion of a sustainable way of life, with its planning focus evenly distributed among all aspects. They particularly stress the creation of an aesthetically pleasing livable environment. In contrast, low-carbon new towns are concerned with the promotion of a sustainable way of production, with an uneven emphasis on the economic sectors such as industrial integration and transformation. However, the master plans only reveal how eco/low-carbon cities are originally intended to differ from non-eco/low-carbon-cities when they start and more comprehensive studies are needed for it to be possible to predict where they will go in the future. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

Sustainable urbanization has been adopted as a keyword in handling these challenges. The Chinese central government has undertaken a variety of measures, including the launch of large Sino-European programs to learn from 'developed nations'. In the wake of these partnerships, a great variety of cross-national and cross-city agreements were signed. Sino-European cooperation does not often run as smoothly as initially hoped because of diverging interests, cultural misunderstandings and practical limitations. In the background, a mismatch in normative conceptions Chinese and European participants have of 'good governance' plays a role. In this contribution, insights taken from Montesquieu's 'The Spirit of Laws' regarding checks and balances and trias politica (updated to 'sextas politica' for the 21st century) are used to comprehend how the exertion of power is distributed and expected to be distributed differently in Chinese than in European administrative traditions.

Such approach does not reduce neither the losses associated with transportation nor the lack of empathy of urban society with the externalities produced in areas placed far from the cities. As an alternative, it proposes to raise energy self-supply by promoting the use of endogenous resources that a city may possess. It was determined that there are several technologies that are available and that can be applied in a city. In spite of the fact that its implementation can be conditioned by the existence of the resource, costs or acceptance of the community, it is urgent that urban planners include the use sustainable energy, in order to meet future shortages of resource and adverse environmental phenomenon. With this proposal we conclude that using the approach of urban metabolism it is possible to promote the use of available renewable energy resources at cities. Based on a general approach, it is shown that it is possible to contribute to change a metabolic linear model to a metabolic circular model. © 2017 WIT Press."

At the same time, institutions of higher education (IHEs) are seeking to contribute to sustainable societies by encouraging students to incorporate principles of environmental responsibility into personal consumption practices. Popular writing on the urban migration of millennials—the generation born after 1982—has frequently celebrated the presumed environmental benefits of cities not designed around the automobile. Yet, little research has examined how, if at all, IHE efforts to shape student consumption practices may impact the sustainability of urban areas where many millennials are choosing to live and work. In this paper, we use survey and qualitative data on undergraduates at a large, public university to compare millennials’ commitment to different forms of sustainable consumption to their preference for particular urban forms. We find that student commitment to practicing sustainable consumption in their adult lives is weakest in an area crucial to the global ecological footprint of urban areas: how food is produced and consumed. We also find that evidence for IHE impact on student attitudes and practices related to any form of sustainable consumption is surprisingly lacking. We conclude by suggesting that IHEs have not yet realized their full potential to prepare millennials to be environmentally responsible citizens of sustainable cities, particularly where participation in food systems is concerned. © 2014, AESS."

Statistical and lexical analyses evidence four main variants of ‘sustainable city’ discourses, subject to debate: ‘green city’, ‘city of short distances’, ‘just city’ and ‘participatory city’. They yield four main findings: first, there is no single model of the ‘sustainable city’; second, the different approaches are not mutually exclusive, be it conceptually, institutionally, practically or geographically; third, the ‘sustainable city’ appears as a genuinely political repertoire – a wide range of actors and institutions act as filters, promoters or detractors; fourth, these situated uses are not fixed but constantly changing, in terms of both contents and procedures.

Cities are generally responsible for most of the global carbon emissions. The sustainability concept has continued to be a top priority on the governmental agenda across the world. Business parks are designed to be environmentally sustainable, which will help reduce air pollution and develop social health and lifestyle. Besides many ecological and environmental services, business parks provide significant social and spiritual benefits to human societies. Green business parks aim to decrease the huge negative effect of business on both nature and society. The main purpose of this paper is to address the importance of green business parks for employees' and users' well-being, and for the sustainability of the city they inhabit. The paper introduces an evaluative framework for the sustainability of green business parks in Egypt. Therefore, the paper discusses the idea of the sustainable city and the connection between human well-being and the constructed environment in business parks. It also studies some cases that have appeared in the Egyptian cities; to show whether they achieve the aspects of sustainability or need redesign and upgrading plans. The study shows a concrete relationship between the indoor environment of business parks and human well-being. This endorses the fact that the more sustainable the place of work, the less its tendency to impose bad health effects on the building's occupants. Highlighting the important role of green business parks for employees' well-being and for a healthy environment can be a step towards future sustainable green cities in Egypt. © 2017 WIT Press."

This article focuses on a thus far relatively understudied aspect of SSTEC, the financial vehicles used to fund SSTEC. The authors find that highly structured and intense collaboration at the national level between China and Singapore plays a catalytic role in attracting many other players to the project by giving them confidence that it is too big to fail. It encourages various preferential policies from lower governmental bodies, broad involvement of the private sector, a market-based operation model and the issuing of bonds in Singapore, which all contribute significantly to Tianjin eco-city's financial viability. The broad involvement of the private sector relieves part of the financial burden from local governments, while the bonds issued in international markets lower the interest rate for master developers. However, the Sino-Singaporean collaboration at the national level is far less likely to be replicated to other eco-cities, since this requires an enormous willingness on the part of other countries to invest manpower, money, and other resources into the construction of eco-cities in China. © 2017 by the author."

The character of virtual networks for smart cities is demonstrated based on three pillars: (1) All-IP-based real-time and adaptive broadband communication networks, (2) global navigation satellite systems and their overlay position correction networks, and (3) the interoperability of ubiquitous sensor network applications, as they form the ICT basis for a multitude of applications that are important in smart cities. The heterogeneity of virtual networks for different smart city physical network services is based on these pillars, taking into account the different requirements for the quality of service (QoS) of data packet transmission, geopositioning, and sensor networks. It can be expected that prosumer activities and resultant networked commons become increasingly relevant for the smart city of the future. However, the increasing role of prosumer activities cannot replace the role of markets in solving scarcity problems within ICT networks as well as physical networks. The role of congestion pricing and QoS differentiation for network capacities in transportation and electricity markets as well as ICT is indicated. If, due to non-rivalry in usage, efficient congestion prices are pointless, the future role of subsidies from the state is considered. © The Author(s) 2017."

Over the last decade, governments in Asia have displayed an appetite and commitment to construct large scale city developments from scratch—one of the most infamous being the smart entrepreneurial city of Songdo, South Korea. Using Songdo as a case study, this paper will examine, from an urban systems perspective, some of the challenges of using a green-city model led by networked technology. More specifically, this study intends to add to the growing body of smart city literature by using an external global event— the global financial crisis in 2008—to reveal what is missing from the smart city narrative in Songdo. The paper will use the definition of an urban system and internal subsystems by Bertuglia et al. (1987) and Bertuglia, Clarke and Wilson (1994) to reveal the sensitivity and resilience of a predetermined smart city narrative. For instance, what happens if the vision moves from the originally intended international-orientated population towards remarketing the city to attract a domestic middle-class population. The lens of the financial crisis in 2008 revealed that the inherent inflexibility of a closed-system approach in Songdo was not sufficiently resilient to external shocks. The shift towards a domestic middle-class population revealed the inequality in accessing the city services in a system designed with formalized and rigid inputs and outputs. By focusing predominantly on technology, the social dimensions of the city were not part of Songdo’s smart city vocabulary. Therefore, in adopting a technologically deterministic approach (Mullins & Shwayri, 2016) to achieving efficiency and combating environmental issues, Songdo’s green city model was found insufficient in its ability to cope with the complexity and dissonance that occurs in relation to “glocal” challenges facing cities today. © 2017 by the author."

This study aims at developing a generic multi-criteria decision support framework for sustainability assessment of the technologies for the treatment of urban sewage sludge. A generic criteria system including both hard and soft criteria in economic, environmental, social and technological aspects was developed for sustainability assessment. The improved analytic hierarchy process method, namely Best-Worst method, was employed to determine the weights of the criteria and the relative priorities of the technologies with respect to the soft criteria. Three MCDM methods including the sum weighted method, digraph model, and TOPSIS were used to determine sustainability sequence of the alternative technologies for the treatment of urban sewage sludge. Three technologies including landfilling, composting, and drying incineration have been studied using the proposed framework. The sustainability sequence of these three technologies determined by these three methods was obtained, and finally the priority sequence was determined as landing filling, drying incineration and composting in the descending order. © 2016 Elsevier Inc."

Since this practice requires significant volumes of water, a resource that is becoming increasingly scarce and expensive, the design criteria and management for use in the preparation of a project must maximize irrigation efficiency. The City of Milan has given us the task of designing a new irrigation system for the Indro Montanelli park, to replace the existing but obsolete system, in line with the principles of exploitation of water resources, cost of implementation and a simpler management system. Improvement in performance both from an agronomic viewpoint and in terms of appearance, functionality and improved usability by users seem to be the main objectives that the administration wishes to reach in the green areas of the park located in the heart of the city. In this paper, the extent of the green heritage of the city and the ways in which it is currently run are analyzed, then the design and management criteria are explained. In the next phase of the work different management criteria are compared, in order to motivate the design choices made, and an irrigation management model on a municipal scale level is also proposed.

In the research literature, it is suggested that these practices are motivated by place-based competition over financial and social capital, combined with more holistic motives of sustainable urban development. However, although an increasing number of green cities are engaged in place branding, few studies have researched the impact of place branding on environmental policy-making in a city, building up to the question: how is local environmental policy-making affected by green place branding? Addressing this issue, this paper critically investigates how the continuity of local environmental policy-making is affected by place-branding practices. To tackle this task, the paper firstly develops an analytical framework aiming to understand how green cities emerge and become famous based on their policy-making. Secondly, using that framework, this paper present an in-depth case study of a city branding itself as the ‘Greenest City in Europe’. Drawing on the growing body of work on green cities, this paper investigates the ‘understudied’ practice of using policy for the purpose of place branding as well as the impact of place branding ‘on the environment’. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

Such approaches provide effective control of stormwater management whilst generating a range of other benefits. However these benefits often occur coincidentally and are not developed or maximised in the original design. Of all the benefits that may accrue, the relevant dominant benefits relating to specific locations and socio-environmental circumstances need to be established, so that flood management functions can be co-designed with these wider benefits to ensure both are achieved during system operation. The paper reviews a number of tools which can evaluate the multiple benefits of SuDS/GI interventions in a variety of ways and introduces new concepts of benefit intensity and benefit profile. Examples of how these concepts can be applied is provided in a case study of proposed SuDS/GI assets in the central area of Newcastle UK. Ways in which SuDS/GI features can be actively extended to develop desired relevant dominant benefits are discussed; e.g., by (i) careful consideration of tree and vegetation planting to trap air pollution; (ii) extending linear SuDS systems such as swales to enhance urban connectivity of green space; and (iii) managing green roofs for the effective attenuation of noise or carbon sequestration. The paper concludes that more pro-active development of multiple benefits is possible through careful co-design to achieve the full extent of urban enhancement SuDS/GI schemes can offer. © 2017 by the author."

This essay provides a critical reflection on the notion of the sustainable city. The central question discussed is: how can the ideal of a sustainable city be best conceptualised? Through exploring historic and contemporary theories on the urban-nature-people relationship and analysing some current sustainable city projects with the help of Cultural Theory, it is argued that creating a sustainable city paradoxically means parting with Sustopia. Sustopia often turns into Dystopia when a single perspective on constructing a sustainable city becomes dominant. In order to assist the process of meaningfully conceptualising the sustainable city, the notion of Cosmopolis is re-explored. This notion of a city embraces creativity, critical practice, adaptation, and it places urban development and planning in a context of multiple spatial and temporal scales. © 2017 by the author."

The results show evidence of the existence of different attitudes towards food as a variable of interest in choosing a destination and tourist experience, while allowing you to explore as these different attitudes have an impact on the behavior of the American tourist. In this regard, greater attitude towards the local cuisine translates into a major tourist impact that implies a higher planned expenditure, a maximum behavioral loyalty, greater appreciation of the quality or degree of innovation of Ecuadorian cuisine. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"
"Breaking resilient patterns of inequality in Santiago de Chile: Challenges to navigate towards a more sustainable city","2016","10.3390/su8080820","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84983761090&doi=10.3390%2fsu8080820&partnerID=40&md5=3305a060b9ec9afb39b219d50ad9d692","Resilience can have desirable and undesirable consequences. Thus, resilience should not be viewed as a normative desirable goal, but as a descriptor of complex systems dynamics. From this perspective, we apply resilience thinking concepts to assess the dynamics of inequality, spatial segregation, and sustainability in Chile's capital city of Santiago. Chile's economy boosted since democracy was restored in 1990, but continuity of neoliberal reforms and transformations of Pinochet's dictatorship (1973-1990) seem to have locked Chilean cities in resilient, albeit unsustainable, patterns of uneven development. Socio-economic data from Santiago shows highly resilient patterns of urban inequality and segregation from 1992 to 2009 despite democratic efforts, political agendas and discourses packed with calls for reducing poverty and inequality. We present a conceptual model based on the notion of stability landscapes to explore potential trade-offs between resilience and sustainable development. We mapped Santiago's spatio-temporal inequality trends and explored if these patterns support an inequality-resilience stability landscape. Analysis of temporal and spatial distribution of development assets across four human development dimensions (i.e., income, education, health, democracy) revealed potential socio-political and spatial feedbacks supporting the resilience of inequality and segregation in Santiago. We argue that urban sustainability may require breaking this resilience, a process where bottom-up stressors such as social movements could play a key role. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

At the same time, they have also sought to use these initiatives to position themselves as climate change leaders and green champions. This paper focuses on the City of Vancouver's Greenest City 2020 Action Plan as urban policy strategy to reduce carbon emissions. Based on interviews with actors and experts involved in the development and implementation of the plan, the paper evaluates the role green leadership aspirations play in shaping urban climate change policy and how policy makers and stakeholders use policy to position the city and its greening initiatives locally and globally. In particular, it analyzes the role of competitive positioning and green leadership in sustainability initiatives and change within and beyond urban boundaries. While leadership suggests increased buy-in of residents and those involved in the implementation of the strategy and multiplication effects through learning within the region and between (peer) cities, it can also pose challenges as the interest in meeting leadership claims can impede more radical change through specific targets and implementation strategies and challenge other sustainability objectives. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

Xi'an is a typical city that has a target to become an eco-city. This city is selected in this case study with the aims of (1) framing eco-practices to enhance the understanding of an eco-city development and (2) evaluating the effect of eco-practices to reveal whether they truly enhance urban sustainability. For the first objective, the framework was constructed in accordance with ecological footprint (EF) theory. For the second objective, environmental pollution was added to an extended EF model. The EF of Xi'an from 1999 to 2014 was calculated and analyzed. The results are as follows: (1)Water pollution control and water area development are core issues in the Xi'an eco-city development. Air pollution control and forest land development also play important roles in the eco-city development; (2) Eco-city practices contribute to the decreases of per capita EF and per capita ecological deficit because of the reduction in the EFs of water area, forest land, and arable land, thereby enhancing urban sustainability; (3) The effect of eco-city practices on the improvement of per capita ecological capacity (EC), the ECs of arable land, water area, pasture land, and forest land are not significant. Based on these results, this study provides practical implications for the promotion of urban sustainability through eco-city development. © 2017 by the authors."
"Different approach to forming sustainable cities: Cittaslow","2017","","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85034050935&partnerID=40&md5=59203b3254a8304f0b9e4d84778613a0","Today, many cities can not adapt to 'urban deformation' escalated by globalisation and to the changes that develop accordingly. 'Fast' evolving lifestyles of the people bring a new identity and structure to cities. In the meantime, these lifestyles also deteriorate basic structural identities quite rapidly. While global processes force the whole world to follow a fast lifestyle, they also affect local lives and give rise to the rapid disappearance of urban differences and authenticities. 'Areas of poor quality with no identity and distinct characteristic features' have thus become the biggest problem of cities. Various urban approaches have started to be shown to solve these problems. One of these approaches is 'sustainable cities' that has emerged for a better environment and social life for the communities. Within the scope of this study, 'Cittaslow' is addressed as a different approach to building sustainable cities. Within this context, by ensuring the notion of 'Cittaslow' is clearly understood, urban parameters suggested by 'Cittaslow' within the framework of sustainability as a solution to modern-day urban problems have been determined. This urban movement, which strives for the protection of authenticity against the impact of globalisation, resists and scrutinises fast lifestyle and its effects on cities and the quality of urban life."

However, in assessing such potentialities, there is insufficient knowledge about the way in which local actors construct, live out and are gripped by this signifier. This article responds to this deficit by exploring how key actors engaged in urban development actually interpret the challenges of the ‘sustainable city'. In part, using a Q methodology study in Bristol and Grenoble, we discern and construct three distinctive discourses of the sustainable city, which we name progressive reformism, public localism, and moral stewardship. Our findings challenge previous critiques of sustainable urbanism. We observe no consistent support for mainstream conceptions of sustainable urban development, but neither do we find significant support for entrepreneurial or radical green localist discourses of the sustainable city. Instead, we identify a common indifference to the tenets of ecological modernization (and, by extension, entrepreneurialism), and a shared skepticism of local self-sufficiency. We thus argue that such discourses offer uncertain foundations upon which to construct new visions of the ‘sustainable city'. In our view, this is because of the transformation of the ‘sustainable city’ from a relatively fixed idea into a floating signifier, coupled with the practices of local practitioners as policy bricoleurs. We conclude that efforts to develop new visions of ‘sustainable cities’ are best served by fostering an agonistic ethos of ‘pragmatic adversarialism’ amongst strategic leaders and stakeholders, which foregrounds politics and the right to difference. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

Using this periodisation, the paper shows how the content of urban sustainability discourse has changed. First, it illustrates that the dominant assumption of sustainable cities’ discourse was to utilise economic growth to ecologically modernise urban environments. Second, it examines how the global economic crisis has intensified this fix and led to a new, even narrower emphasis on the techno-economic value of those aspects of urban environment that have economic and market potential. Third, it analyses the fragmenting of sustainable cities’ discourse into a set of competing logics that reflect this narrower agenda. This paper argues that the sustainable city has been absorbed into these new logics that are much more narrowly techno-economically focused and are squeezing out traditional concerns with social justice and equity. © 2017 The Author(s).

Furthermore, the pollutant impacts of these vehicles are very high also at urban scale. Many cities are trying to propose planning strategies aimed at reducing these external impact of freight transport through sustainable transport policies. The idea of introducing a toll for rationalize the use of the road infrastructures by freight vehicles in city logistics is one of the most common Transportation Demand Management policies. The development of ITS technologies today allow to design these pricing schemes in several ways connecting the price to individual trips either on the congestion level as well as to the freight vehicle consumption\emission characteristics or the size and the loading factor. The road–pricing is a well–established practice all round the world. One of the main limits of the available case studies is that they don’t take into account the impacts on the acceptance and on equity among the freight carriers. The aim of the study is to propose a new look in designing a sustainable city logistics road pricing schemes based on transport–related “acceptance and equity” measures useful for enlarge both the acceptance of this policy among the carriers and the equity produced in term of transport costs supported by the freight companies competing in the market. The origin–destination net perceived utility s(V) is the variable proposed as an acceptance and equity measure. The idea was to consider the dispersion of s(V) as a measure of equity and the change in s(V) deriving from a road–pricing scheme as an inverse measure of acceptance (the smaller the change the larger is the acceptance of the policy among freight carriers). Furthermore, an application to a toy network was performed to test the benefit and the applicability of the proposed measure at reducing external and internal impacts deriving from a city logistics policy. © 2017 WIT Press."

Currently, however, we lack integrative guidelines on how to manage trade-offs between urban densification and the provision of green space. Against this background, this study applies the concepts of green infrastructure and ecosystem services to develop a guideline for landscape planning to foster compact and green cities. The guideline was tested on the example of the landscape plan of Dresden (Germany), which foresees a compact city in a green network. Results show that the concepts of ecosystems services and green infrastructure can support urban practitioners in structuring the complex interrelations between landscape planning and compact and green cities. The developed guideline provides an integrative framework for modular landscape planning that: (1) reflects the spatial heterogeneity and properties of urban ecosystems and landscapes; and (2) considers cities as integrated socio-ecological systems. The case study indicates that a more comprehensive perspective of cities and their ecosystem is required, one that connects green with grey infrastructure. Further research should focus on how the green infrastructure concept can be refined to incorporate strategic planning for compact cities. © 2017 by the author."

It highlights some important processes that are overlooked in these debates and advances a new, socially inclusive urbanization agenda that addresses emerging urban land grabs. The global land rush debate has ignored not only the fact that large-scale land investments take place in a context of rapid urbanization, but also that these investments are often triggered by urban demand, whereas discussions on the new urban agenda prepared for the latest United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development (Habitat III) are typically city-biased, and pay little attention to the role of increasing cross-border investment in land and the transformation of the countryside. Using cases from areas where the global land rush and urbanization are simultaneously intensifying in the global South, we identify four areas that should be prioritized in current debates, namely the impacts of land investments on intra-city dynamics, peri-urban dynamics, and the emergence of new cities and new infrastructure corridors. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd"

They are very much trapped between policies and guidelines issued by the government and a market economy controlled by developers. The government has issued some overall recommendations for establishing eco-cities in China built on resource efficiency principles, but they lack more hands-on guidelines to be used by urban planners. Several of the most well-known eco-city projects have also encountered difficulties in the implementation phase. One problem is that the frameworks have not been developed bottom-up in a local participation process but have mainly been imported from other projects, in several cases from international experiences. This creates a gap between planning and implementation. The traditional way of planning in China is done in a sectoral way. That is, different sectors, like transport, energy, water, waste, and environment, are planned separately. This is also reflected in the lack of cooperation between the different city departments and companies responsible for energy, water, and transport. The overall aim of this study was to develop and test a new simplified framework that can guide urban planners when developing the master plan for a city or a city area aiming at becoming an eco-city. The framework developed was applied in devising a more comprehensive and integrated plan for the city of Xuzhou based on cross-sectoral planning. Meeting the future challenges of a growing population and consumption of a third planning level, the 3R level, is proposed in this paper. This is in line with a growing skepticism towards the belief in ecological modernization. In order to avoid the problem of finding exact definitions for concepts, such as sustainability and eco-city as used in China, an approach with three levels of ambition for sustainability and sustainable development was adopted. Each level of ambition requires different planning approaches related to sectoral, cross sectoral, and 3R planning. The framework will next be refined and applied in other eco-city projects in China. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers."

In this context, the use of recycled water from treated domestic sewage in agricultural activities is gaining ground. Reuse water can combine environmental protection and high agricultural productivity, especially for simultaneously carrying plant nutrients and minimizing demands for catching “noble” fresh water from streams and water sources for irrigation, currently the highest water consuming activity. The increasing urbanization contributes to generate, but also to foster the treatment and use of wastewater, since urban areas are, at one time, chief water consumers and chief sewage producers. Although there are cultural and sanitary impediments for using recycled water on large scale and the knowledge about possible existing treatments is still limited, a safe alternative to integrate the reuse water into the productive process is its use in irrigation projects involving non edible species. Among these, plants used in floriculture and landscaping can be great allies for the development of wastewater-based urban and peri-urban horticulture, encouraging local development, creating jobs and aiding to environmental protection.

To implement its objectives, the SSTEC has been developed as a central element in a matrix of networked institutional relationships. This paper examines the functioning of these institutional interactions, through examination of the development of renewable energy-related initiatives. The salient elements of these interactions relate to consultation and information flows. This is intended to facilitate an empirically based experimental approach to project planning, implementation and review, in terms of the integration of research and implementation experience. Institutional and regulatory development at the SSTEC is evaluated in the context of other Chinese low-carbon cities and other localised initiatives such as Green Counties and New Energy Demonstration Cities. This evaluation draws on interviews with senior staff members at the SSTEC, and in specialist Chinese renewable energy institutions, as well as scholarly and other literature. While substantial implementation challenges face the SSTEC and other large-scale projects, they are likely to play an instrumental role in scaling-up technologically and financially effective low-carbon solutions in Chinese urban development. Some inefficiencies and failures are to be expected in any experimental approach. These can be put to effective use through an empirical approach to determining best institutional and regulatory practice, in terms of realising China's low-carbon model of sustainable urban development. © 2017 WIT Press."

The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) include a goal on cities (Goal 11), with most other goals and targets have urban applications and multi scalar implications for their implementation. Further, the interdependencies — including synergies and trade-offs — among the various SDGs are greater in cities, presenting both challenges and opportunities. A systems approach is urgently needed in urban research and policy analysis, but such an approach rarely features in current analysis or urban decision-making for various reasons. This paper explores four questions: why a systems approach is necessary, what defines such an approach, why has this rarely been adopted in practice, and what can be done to promote its use. We argue that a systems approach can reveal unrecognized opportunities to maximize co-benefits and synergies, guide management of inevitable trade-offs, and therefore inform prioritisation and successful solutions. We present four key issues for the effective implementation of the SDGs and the New Urban Agenda, which emerged from UN Habitat III Conference, namely: (a) a radical redesign of the multilateral institutional setup on urban issues; (b) promoting regenerative culture, behaviour, and design; (c) exploring ways to finance a systems approach; and (d) a new and enhanced role for science in sustainable development.

Then all indicators are classified into three implementation stages (e.g. regional control indicators, park management indicators, and block control indicators) to ensure the fully accomplishment of low-carbon targets, which are always neglected by researchers, planners, governments and city managers. In the end, two scenarios are adopted, while the former is developing in traditional way and the latter is under the circumstance that all indicators are accomplished, to calculate the carbon reduction in order to quantitatively evaluate the effect of the indicator system. The results reveal that the policy makers should give the priority to indicators related to green buildings (e.g. ratio of green buildings), utilization of renewable energy, green transportation (e.g. mixed land use, green travel, green vehicles, etc.), greenery (green coverage ratio, multi-coat landscaping planting system etc.) while establishing policies and guidance towards a low-carbon eco-city."

The research methodology is based on a modelling framework that exploit datasets from Canadian cities concerning land use, source and tap water quality, water infrastructure and operations, and estimations on future changes on water temperature and local rainfall. The paper concludes with the initiatives that municipalities must conduct in order to implement sustainable strategies for adapting to climate changes regarding drinking water resources. © 2017 WIT Press."

This article explains variation among Canadian cities regarding policies adopted to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, with a particular focus on green building standards. By applying insights from the study of the politics of public policy to urban politics, this article finds that while electoral disincentives prevent most cities from enacting high impact green building policies, the success of some cities can be attributed to the influence of independent municipal environment departments. These departments facilitate policy learning by providing information and resources. The findings suggest that policy makers could improve the effectiveness of local climate change policy by creating municipal environment departments that have organizational capacity-funding, staff, and a cross-cutting mandate-and are insulated from interference from politicians and line departments. © 2016 Canadian Political Science Association."

This article highlights this advantage of fuzzy sets theory by discussing how it can be appropriately applied to a research problem related to city characterization. Using eco-city as a hypothetical case, this article demonstrates a fuzzy sets application and its three basic fuzzy sets operations, namely complementation or negation, union and intersection in eco-city classification. Arbitrarily selected eco-city attributes include green coverage, recycling ratio and the rate of vehicle increase. This article finally suggests important research areas, possible policy recommendations and noticeable difficulties in spatial and regional study that can utilize the proposed fuzzy sets approach. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Ltd."

Specifically, it probes the ways in which this form has emerged from different perspectives, why it has become institutionalized and interwoven with politics and policy—urban dissemination, as well as the risks it poses to environmental sustainability in the context thereof. To achieve these aims, an analytical and philosophical framework of STS is adopted, which supports analyses and evaluations whose approaches are drawn from a variety of disciplinary and theoretical perspectives. The study shows that smart sustainable cities are discursively construed and materially produced by the socially constructed understandings and socially anchored and institutionalized practices pertaining to ICT of the new wave of computing for urban sustainability. Thereby, such cities are medicated by and situated within ecologically and technologically advanced societies. And as urban manifestations of scientific knowledge and technological innovation, they are shaped by, and also shape, socio–cultural and politico–institutional structures. In addition, the study demonstrates that the success and expansion of smart sustainable cities stem from the transformational power, knowledge/power relation, productive and constitutive force, and legitimation capacity underlying ICT of the new wave of computing for urban sustainability due to its association with the scientific discourse and its societal entailments. This form of S&T is, however, shown to pose risks to environmental sustainability. Therefore, it needs to be reoriented in a more environmentally sustainable direction, as it can not, as currently practiced, solve the complex environmental problems placed in the agenda of smart sustainable cities as a holistic approach to urban development. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd"

Alleged eco-cities are being built across a variety of spaces via processes of urbanisation triggering substantial environmental, social and economic impacts. This article investigates how new eco-city projects interpret and practice urban sustainability by focusing on the policy context that underpins their development. The article argues that projects for new eco-cities are shaped in loci by policy agendas tailored around specific economic and political targets. In these terms, the ideas and strategies of urban sustainability adopted by eco-city developers are understood as reflections of broader policy priorities. The case study employed in this article, Masdar City, reveals how the Emirati eco-city initiative is the product of local agendas seeking economic growth via urbanisation to preserve the political institutions of Abu Dhabi. Following the economic imperatives set by the ruling class, the Masdar City project interprets sustainability as ecological modernisation and practices urban environmentalism almost exclusively in economic terms. The article shows how the developers of Masdar City capitalise on sustainability by building an urban platform to develop and commercialise clean-tech products, and concludes that the Emirati alleged eco-city is an example of urban eco-modernisation: a high-tech urban development informed by market analysis rather than ecological studies. © 2015, © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2015."

This review focuses on full-scale in situ and remotely sensed measurements of atmospheric winds, temperature, and humidity in cities and links measurements to current modeling and simulation needs. A key conclusion of this review is that there is a need for urban-specific measurement techniques including measurements of highly-resolved three-dimensional fields at sampling frequencies high enough to capture small-scale turbulence processes yet also capable of covering spatial extents large enough to simultaneously capture key features of urban heterogeneity and boundary layer processes while also supporting the validation of current and emerging modeling capabilities. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd."

While there is significant attention to asserting that such a relationship exists, or ought to exist, there have been no efforts to explicitly and empirically link city policies to health outcomes. This paper tackles this issue head-on, investigating the extent to which cities in the US that have the most aggressive sustainability initiatives exhibit better health outcomes than cities with less aggressive sustainability initiatives.

For developing this model, REMOURBAN is implementing several strategies at city level based on: the creation of a holistic catalogue of innovative technologies and solutions on energy, mobility and ICTs favouring the replicability, the identification and overcome of nontechnical barriers, the development of new integrated business models oriented at the creation of a European market for innovation and the definition of a complete evaluation procedure using sustainability and smartness indicators. This urban renovation strategy is focused on the citizens, where they become the cornerstones to making a smart city a reality For this reason, citizens are being actively engaged in REMOURBAN and the population awareness about energy and environmental impact of their daily activities are increased. In order to ensure the usefulness and high replication of the REMOURBAN project at European level, the sustainable urban regeneration model is aimed at the decision makers, investors, public administrations and the industrial sector. Furthermore, in order to ensure this replicability, two follower cities, Seraing (Belgium) and Miskolc (Hungary) are involved in the project so they can apply the developed model once it is validated. The project will allow demonstrating that, by means of improving the current conditions of a city, it is possible to achieve low energy districts and more sustainable urban transport, as well as to perceive a greater quality of life. REMOURBAN, thus, will focus on improving the energy efficiency, reduction of GHG emissions, refurbishment of districts, transport sustainability, access to urban information and citizen engagement. A big impact across Europe is intended to be achieved by the REMOURBAN project results at European level, showing the model for sustainable urban regeneration can be easily applied and replicated. With the aim at maximizing the impact of the project results, REMOURBAN is deploying a powerful communication and dissemination plan that integrates a citizen engagement strategy and has started to disseminate the benefits of the project to a wide variety of audiences. © 2016 by author(s) and VsI Entrepreneurship and Sustainability Center."

This includes the aspect of citizen participation and a stronger bottom up orientation in decision-making processes, the aspect this paper homes in on. We will examine the realities of citizen participation in eco-city development in China at the local level and do this in one of the most prosperous and administratively forward looking cities in China, Suzhou. The analytical framework with which this analysis is conducted is a combination of Arnstein's participation ladder and the three dimensions in Fung's cube. The two cases we have studied are an eco-city project in a village community and one in the old city, to ensure we cover two different modes of participation, one rural and one urban. Three dimensions (participant selection, mode of communication and conversion of discussion output into action) and two policy making phases (decision-making and implementation) are applied to allow for a systematic comparison of the two cases. We find that citizen participation in the rural community is far more collectivist and reactive, while that in the urban setting is more individualist and proactive. Furthermore, in both cases, citizen input in the decision-making phase is quite limited, while during implementation local government appreciates the support and practical input locals can supply. To further enhance citizen participation along the lines proposed in ‘new-type urbanization’, legislative reform and professionalization of officials in dealing with bottom-up input would be essential. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

The main issues involved in urban sustainability are buildings, energy, food, green areas and landscape, mobility, urban planning, water and waste; and their improvement is promoted through different strategies. However, a quantitative method, such as life cycle thinking (LCT), is essential to evaluating these strategies. This paper reviews LCT studies related to urban issues to identify the main research gaps in the evaluation of these improvement strategies. The review identifies the main sustainability strategies associated with each urban issue and compiles articles that deal with these strategies through LCT, including environmental life cycle assessment (LCA), life cycle costing (LCC), social LCA (S-LCA) and life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA), as well as integrated analyses with combined tools. Water, waste and buildings are the urban issues that accounted for a larger amount of studies. In contrast, a limited number of papers assessed urban planning and energy (excluding energy in buildings). Strong interrelations among urban issues were identified, most of them including water. In terms of methods, 79% of the studies exclusively applied life cycle tools (i.e., LCA, LCC, S-LCA or LCSA). Within this group, the environmental dimension was the focus of 84% of the papers. Single environmental indicators (e.g., global warming) were common in 20% of the analyses, highlighting the need to integrate more impact categories to prevent trade-offs. In the field of social and sustainability assessment, there is a need for methodological advances that foster their application in urban areas. Further research should cover the thematic and methodological gaps identified in this paper, such as developing models that assess complex urban issues, generating comprehensive LCT studies and promoting multi-indicators. Life cycle tools might benefit from revising the methodology with stakeholders to optimize the understanding and communication of life cycle results for policy- and decision-making processes. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

Drawing from the fields of public health, urban planning and environmental justice, we argue that public health and epidemiology researchers should rely on a more dynamic model of community that accounts for the potential unintended social consequences of upstream health interventions. In our example of green gentrification, the health benefits of greening can only be fully understood relative to the social and political environments in which inequities persist. We point to two key questions regarding the health benefits of newly added green space: Who benefits in the short and long term from greening interventions in lower income or minority neighbourhoods undergoing processes of revitalisation? And, can green cities be both healthy and just? We propose the Green Gentrification and Health Equity model which provides a framework for understanding and testing whether gentrification associated with green space may modify the effect of exposure to green space on health. © The author(s) 2017."

In a deductive model, we find that inequivalent economic growth in urban-rural area results in the variability of eco-efficiency of industrial production in urban area, which increases the risks of environmental effect to adjacent suburban and rural area, and directly affects changes of unobserved environmental effect spatial-temporally. Through ecological intercorrelation, both observed and unobserved environmental effects in this dynamic mechanism are formed, consequently intensify the regional inequality of environmental pollution, and frustrate the future coordinative development of regional economy. By employing the data of case study area of Gaoyou in China, estimations show that observed eco-efficiency is getting better but unobserved eco-efficiency is getting worse until this place becomes an eco-city. This study has proved that ecological intercorrelation in some extent sustains unobserved environmental effects to affect regional environmental degradation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd"

This has been boosted by the new digital transition in ICT. Driving such transition predominantly are big data analytics and context-aware computing and their increasing amalgamation within a number of urban domains, especially as their functionality involve more or less the same core enabling technologies, namely sensing devices, cloud computing infrastructures, data processing platforms, middleware architectures, and wireless networks. Topical studies tend to only pass reference to such technologies or to largely focus on one particular technology as part of big data and context-aware ecosystems in the realm of smart cities. Moreover, empirical research on the topic, with some exceptions, is generally limited to case studies without the use of any common conceptual frameworks. In addition, relatively little attention has been given to the integration of big data analytics and context-aware computing as advanced forms of ICT in the context of smart sustainable cities. This endeavor is a first attempt to address these two major strands of ICT of the new wave of computing in relation to the informational landscape of smart sustainable cities. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to review and synthesize the relevant literature with the objective of identifying and distilling the core enabling technologies of big data analytics and context-aware computing as ecosystems in relevance to smart sustainable cities, as well as to illustrate the key computational and analytical techniques and processes associated with the functioning of such ecosystems. In doing so, we develop, elucidate, and evaluate the most relevant frameworks pertaining to big data analytics and context-aware computing in the context of smart sustainable cities, bringing together research directed at a more conceptual, analytical, and overarching level to stimulate new ways of investigating their role in advancing urban sustainability. In terms of originality, a review and synthesis of the technical literature has not been undertaken to date in the urban literature, and in doing so, we provide a basis for urban researchers to draw on a set of conceptual frameworks in future research. The proposed frameworks, which can be replicated and tested in empirical research, will add additional depth and rigor to studies in the field. In addition to reviewing the important works, we highlight important applications as well as challenges and open issues. We argue that big data analytics and context-aware computing are prerequisite technologies for the functioning of smart sustainable cities of the future, as their effects reinforce one another as to their efforts for bringing a whole new dimension to the operating and organizing processes of urban life in terms of employing a wide variety of big data and context-aware applications for advancing sustainability. © 2017, The Author(s)."

A multilevel perspective approach used in sustainability transitions studies is applied as a model to describe them. The aim is to illustrate interactions and barriers arising in the implementation of densification policies. The argument suggests that despite a shift of paradigm in planning towards sustainability, urban regimes have remained rather stable. Some progress has been made, but further advancing the sustainability agenda may require new rules in the regime – for example, new planning policies integrated with taxation and financial instruments, and transport regulations – and a stronger emphasis on niche developments. © 2016 Elsevier B.V."

The ecological wisdom embodied in these high-performance prototypes may give us clues to sustainable urban infrastructure. In this paper we highlight some of the amazing ecologically wise natural habitats. Although many amazing natural examples have been recently highlighted, emulating them in engineering practice has remained a challenge. One of the most promising biological processes that are closest to human adaptation is biomineralisation by which living organisms produce minerals, chiefly carbonate products that offer strength to bones, shells and antlers. With the help of some microorganisms, it is possible to produce and deposit minerals (e.g. calcium carbonate) and emulate some of the biological processes such as formation of corals.

Then we present what the French framework is, and what tools to promote and elaborate eco-neighbourhoods there are in France. Thirdly, in fact, both French policies, national and local, concerning eco-neighbourhood projects, seem to integrate means of assessing urban projects and this assessment achieves a kind of certification. While the Ministry in charge of Urban Planning has developed the national EcoQuartier (""EcoNeighbourhood"" in English) certification, the City of Paris and other local authorities have designed similar tools, which integrate a large number of parameters dealing with urban sustainability and which are designed to evolve over time. Finally, we discuss whether the French tool is really original and whether it prefigures new practices in the field of sustainable urban development. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd."

What is more, recognizing the diversity of aspirations that may never be reconciled into a consensus, might some innovations and policy interventions be nevertheless more privileged than others, in being non-foreclosing? How might we discover this? These questions are addressed through a computational case study of London. The city's metabolism is modeled as the set of interacting, cross-sectoral (water, food, energy, waste) flows of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), water, and energy. Given various degrees of target improvements in an accompanying set of metabolic performance metrics, and given four candidate technological innovations in the water sector, an inverse (or “backcasting”) analysis is implemented in order to identify the key technological, policy, social, and climate-related features determining whether the community's aspirations — through the surrogates of the metabolic performance metrics — are attainable (or not), under substantial uncertainty. From this, the paper proceeds to examine which businesses are currently marketing some of the so-identified key technological innovations. It closes with a brief review of the related status of the economic justifications and social changes that may either promote or stifle the opportunities for London to move towards a higher niveau of sustainability. © 2016 The Authors"

And it is rapidly gaining momentum and worldwide attention as a promising response to the challenge of urban sustainability. This pertains particularly to ecologically and technologically advanced nations. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the field of smart (and) sustainable cities in terms of its underlying foundations and assumptions, state–of–the art research and development, research opportunities and horizons, emerging scientific and technological trends, and future planning practices. As to the design strategy, the paper reviews existing sustainable city models and smart city approaches. Their strengths and weaknesses are discussed with particular emphasis being placed on the extent to which the former contributes to the goals of sustainable development and whether the latter incorporates these goals. To identify the related challenges, those models and approaches are evaluated and compared against each other in line with the notion of sustainability. The gaps in the research within the field of smart sustainable cities are identified in accordance with and beyond the research being proposed. As a result, an integrated approach is proposed based on an applied theoretical perspective to align the existing problems and solutions identification for future practices in the area of smart sustainable urban planning and development. As to the findings, the paper shows that critical issues remain unsettled, less explored, largely ignored, and theoretically underdeveloped for applied purposes concerning existing models of sustainable urban form as to their contribution to sustainability, among other things. It also reveals that numerous research opportunities are available and can be realized in the realm of smart sustainable cities. Our perspective on the topic in this regard is to develop a theoretically and practically convincing model of smart sustainable city or a framework for strategic smart sustainable urban development. This model or framework aims to address the key limitations, uncertainties, paradoxes, and fallacies pertaining to existing models of sustainable urban form—with support of ICT of the new wave of computing and the underlying big data and context–aware computing technologies and their advanced applications. We conclude that the applied theoretical inquiry into smart sustainable cities of the future is deemed of high pertinence and importance—given that the research in the field is still in its early stages, and that the subject matter draws upon contemporary and influential theories with practical applications. The comprehensive overview of and critique on existing work on smart (and) sustainable cities provide a valuable and seminal reference for researchers and practitioners in related research communities and the necessary material to inform these communities of the latest developments in the area of smart sustainable urban planning and development. In addition, the proposed holistic approach is believed to be the first of its kind. That is, it has not been, to the best of one's knowledge, investigated or produced elsewhere. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

In many designs this has been translates into high-rise buildings with a focus on energy management at their outer envelopes. However, pursuing this building focused approach alone means that buildings are treated as stand-alone entities with minimal consideration to their impact on the surrounding urban landscape and vice versa. Where urban density is high, individual buildings interact with each other, reducing access to sunshine and daylight, obstructing airflow and raising outdoor air temperature. If/when each building pursues its own sustainability agenda without regard to its urban context, the result will diminish the natural energy resources available to nearby buildings and worsen the outdoor environment generally. This paper examines some of these urban impacts using examples from the City of London where rapid transformation is taking place as very tall buildings with exceptional energy credentials are being inserted into a low-rise city without a plan for the overall impact of urban form. The focus of the paper is on access to sunshine and wind and the wider implications of sustainable strategies that that focuses on individual buildings to the exclusion of the surrounding urban landscape. The work highlights the need for a framework that accounts for the synergistic outcomes that result from the mutual interactions of buildings in urban spaces. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

There is also a growing understanding that urban development and food systems cannot be decoupled from rural development given the multiple impacts that urban areas have on their surroundings. In recent years the concept of City Region Food Systems (CRFS) has emerged as a promising approach to support local governments, policy makers, and multi-stakeholder bodies in making informed decisions to improve urban and regional food system sustainability and resilience, while taking into account a more integrated approach to territorial development across urban and rural areas. This paper is based on an ongoing FAO and RUAF programme of assessing and planning City Region Food Systems, currently implemented in eight city regions in Canada, Colombia, Ecuador, Senegal, Sri Lanka, The Netherlands, and Zambia. The paper analyses the content, definition and delimitations of the concept of City Region Food Systems by presenting two case studies from Latin America (Quito and Medellín), and discusses first advances in policy uptake and territorial food planning. © 2017 by the authors."

These problems have a great influence on the environmental performance of those cities. Egyptian cities are no exception to such cities. Recently, Egypt has been undergoing rapid urbanization and industrialization. It is claimed that there have been various undesired effects on the environment resulting from these development processes. In fact, it could be said that development processes, as a result of national policy over the past 3 decades, are associated with a wide range of problems and impacts on the environment. In this respect, sustainability has been the most trending issue in developing urban communities all over the world. Great efforts have been made through sustainable urban design to enhance the quality of life. Furthermore, it is advocated that to make these communities sustainable, a comprehensive management of their systems is essential. This research advocates that green mechanisms within urban management in Egypt would offer appropriate solutions for their problems. This research casts light on one of the recent green urban management evaluation mechanisms. The African Green City Index is adopted in this research to examine the environmental performance of three new cities in Egypt, and the commitment made to reducing the environmental impact associated with their urban development. The research concludes with the identification of green policy proposals for improving the selected cities' environmental performance and urban management. These proposals could be considered as initiatives and guidelines for other Egyptian cities and could pave the way for identifying appropriate policies for enhancing the quality of green city urban systems within the Egyptian context. © The Author 2017."

In the face of a wide experimentation, the aim of this paper is to answer the question: what progress is implemented by the goal of sustainable city? To this end, I hold it is important point at the watershed between the declared intended goals of the projects realized to date and the results on the ground. To analyze this discrepancy, I have identified a common theory-practice gap in the form of the three pitfalls of sustainable city, which bring about economic and ethical conflicts and risks creating socio-spatial utopias. The three pitfalls are: (1) the idea of the city as a business; (2) the oversimplification of urban complexity; (3) the quest for the ideal community. This conceptual framework has two purposes. First, it helps to systematize the existing literature on the sustainable city project, focusing on few selected issues. Second, it offers a project evaluation framework, useful both for the management of resources and for the planning of urban space. To pinpoint these pitfalls in projects for sustainable cities could allow us to adopt a holistic approach to the city project and practice. © 2017 by the author."

Despite the burgeoning utilization of GeoICT, the development of frameworks of components and guidelines is still at the infancy. This is due to the fact that GeoICT implementations are guided by contextual factors and there is no one size fits all approach. This paper focuses on the topic of leveraging GeoICT for smart sustainable cities by examining the Saudi Arabian experience using information from the literature, government websites, official documents, newspaper articles and personal interviews. This study reviews the definitions, typologies, and frameworks of implementing GeoICT and smart cities. It highlights case studies of smart city development in Saudi Arabia. A comparison of the Saudi case studies with frameworks and practices found in the literature is presented. This paper concludes with policy implications for Saudi Arabia and lessons for GeoICT and smart city development. It is concluded that local context has an influence on the implementation of smart cities, ICT infrastructure is necessary but not sufficient for developing smart cities and blending top-down with bottom-up approaches is essential. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

But, the economic viability and sustainability of city centers is threatened by problems related to transport, such as pollution, congestion, and parking. Much has been written about automated vehicles and demand responsive transport. The combination of these potentially disruptive developments could reduce these problems. However, implementation is held back by uncertainties, including public acceptance, liability, and privacy. So, their potential to reduce urban transport problems may not be fully realized. We propose an adaptive approach to implementation that takes some actions right away and creates a framework for future actions that allows for adaptations over time as knowledge about performance and acceptance of the new system (called ‘automated taxis’) accumulates and critical events for implementation take place. The adaptive approach is illustrated in the context of a hypothetical large city. © 2017"

Recently, attention has begun to focus on the perceived shortcomings in the practical delivery of related initiatives, with several publications suggesting a gap between ambitious policy goals and the emerging realities of the newly built environment. To probe this further, in this article we examine – based on the policy network approach – how the gap between high-level national policies and local practice implementation can be explained in the current Chinese context. We develop a four-pronged typology of eco city projects based on differential involvement of key (policy) actor groups, followed by a mapping of what are salient policy network relations among these actors in each type. Our analysis suggests that, within the overall framework of national policy, a core axis in the network relations is that between local government and land developers. In some cases, central government agencies – often with buy-in from international architecture, engineering and consulting firms – seek to influence local government planning through various incentives aimed at rendering sustainability a serious consideration. However, this is mostly done in a top-down manner, which overemphasizes a rational, technocratic planning mode while underemphasizing interrelationships among actors. This makes the emergence of a substantial implementation gap in eco city practice an almost predictable outcome. Consequently, we argue that special attention be paid in particular to the close interdependency between the interests of local government actors and those of land and real estate developers. Factoring in this aspect of the policy network is essential if eco city implementation is to gain proper traction on the ground. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd"

In the case of the Chilean capital, Santiago, the underground (Metro), has generated sub-centralities, densification and potentiated real estate development in certain parts of the city, but has had negligible effects in others. Our research aims at trying to enhance the positive effects of a mass transit network such as Metro, to improve two large malaises of the city: its increasing urban sprawl and its unacceptable social segregation. Both problems are not unique to Santiago, but are shared by many Latin American conurbations. To do so, we first analysed and classified the areas around Metro stations, based on their social and urban characteristics, and densification potential. We then identified existing and potential subsidies to promote social integration and densification and, finally, we applied a stated choice experiment to real estate developers to inquire into their willingness to build in the vicinity of selected GIS-classified stations. In a previous paper, we discussed the models estimated with the stated choice data, and the expected results of applying packages of incentives for densification in the vicinity of different Metro stations. In this paper, we seek to identify mechanisms to increase both housing density and, at the same time, promote social integration in the vicinity of Metro stations, by identifying a typology of urban areas that respond differently to such incentives. Our results show that the effectiveness of the various incentives depends, to a great extent, on the urban characteristics of the Metro station surroundings. For example, in stations located in the central areas of the city incentives to stimulate real estate activity are not really necessary, as the process is well underway; however, in Metro stations located in industrial areas incentives are more effective in triggering real estate dynamics, especially direct demand incentives for any buyer or with a limited time frame. Finally, in peripheral Metro stations located in low standard social housing areas, the incentives tend to be less effective and are probably not enough to trigger a significant densification or integration process; hence, probably other type of governmental action, such as pilot or demonstration projects, should be sought for these cases. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

These alternatives have not been widely adopted among real estate developers, actors with large influence over urban form and function. Existing explanations for this failure enumerate market and regulatory barriers but do not sufficiently describe the institutional structures that allow conventional approaches to prevail. A failure of real estate developers to adopt alternative forms of development can best be described in terms of a rigidity trap. Specifically, norms of practice within the real estate development industry combine with market and regulatory factors to favor existing practices and limit innovation. Moreover, these institutional factors also buffer the real estate development industry from feedback mechanisms and external signals that might otherwise trigger adaptation. Addressing the environmental consequences of urbanization not only requires novel approaches to urban design, but will also necessitate addressing systemic pathologies in the design implementation process. © 2017 by the author(s)."

Considering the energy configuration and environmental suitability assessment, the outdoor local climate and thermal comfort conditions in a regional area should be effectively evaluated and analyzed to satisfy the resource-saving and environment-friendly demands. This paper proposes a new local climatic evaluation system (LCES) to predict and express local climatic patterns under different urban forms. The system has three modules: a pre-processing module, a dynamic calculation module, and a post-processing module. The pre-processing module uses GIS for parameter design and statistics. The calculation module adopts a regional climatic prediction model to calculate hourly climatic parameters from five dynamically linked sub-modules. The post-processing module expresses the climatic spatial visualizations through the temporal-spatial distributions of climatic parameters. We applied the LCES to conduct the climatic spatial analysis of a planning region in Shenzhen, China. Results from this case study show that local climate varies according to local urban form. During the research period, the average hourly urban heat island intensity (UHII) varied between −0.5 °C and 3 °Cand the average hourly new standard effective temperature (SET) varied from 24 °C to 40 °C across the research area. We then used threshold values of UHII and SET to identify problem areas for further analysis and re-planning. This user-friendly, integrated climatic evaluation system helps design climatic friendly urban environments. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd"
"A comparative study of driving performance in metropolitan regions using large-scale vehicle trajectory data: Implications for sustainable cities","2017","10.1080/15568318.2016.1230803","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85008889794&doi=10.1080%2f15568318.2016.1230803&partnerID=40&md5=457949b3ccb72040b6802653e71e3b32","Volatile driving, characterized by hard accelerations and braking, can contribute substantially to higher energy consumption, tailpipe emissions, and crash risks. Drivers’ decisions to maintain speed, accelerate, brake rapidly, or jerk their vehicle are largely constrained by their unique regional and metropolitan contexts. These contexts may be characterized by their geography, roadway structure, traffic management, driving population, etc. This study captures how people generally drive in a region using large-scale vehicle trajectory data, implying how energy is consumed and how emissions are produced in regional transportation systems. Specifically, driving performance in four U.S. metropolitan areas (Los Angeles, San Francisco, Sacramento, and Atlanta) is compared, taking advantage of large-scale behavioral data (78.7 million seconds of speed records), collected by in-vehicle global positioning systems (GPSs) as part of regional surveys. Comparative analysis shows significant regional differences in terms of volatile driving and time spent to accelerate, brake, and jerk the vehicle during daily trips. Correlates of higher volatility are also explored, e.g., battery electric vehicles show low volatility, as expected. This study proposes a novel way to compare regional driving performance by successfully turning GPS driving data into valuable knowledge that can be applied in practice by developing regional driving performance indices. The new indices can also be used to compare regional performance over time and to imply the levels of sustainability of regional transportation systems. This study contributes by proposing a way to extract useful information from large-scale driving data. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."
"Planning resilient and sustainable cities: Identifying and targeting social vulnerability to climate change","2017","10.3390/su9081394","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85026827425&doi=10.3390%2fsu9081394&partnerID=40&md5=3227aaf2af81a791d74cfad3d9ea8763","This research offers a new framework for assessing social vulnerability to climate change. A social vulnerability assessment trial was carried out for Chinese coastal cities at the county level. First, the 10 factors having the most influence on social vulnerability were identified. They are “House with no lavatory”, “House with no bath facilities”, “Employees in primary industry”, “Houses with no tap water”, “GDP in primary sector”, “Children”, “House with no kitchen”, “Rate of natural increase (RNI), “Employees in management sector”, and “Highly educated”. Second, indexes of social vulnerability, exposure, sensitivity, and adaptability were evaluated and mapped to examine their spatial pattern. The results demonstrate that the distribution of exposure index (EI) is similar to that of social vulnerability index (SVI): many counties are categorized at the medium level while a few counties belong to the high or low categories. The distribution of adaptability proves that it should be paid more attention, as 30.14% of its counties belong to the lowest level. After calculating the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic of SVI, two cold spots and two hot spots are identified. Third, the relationship between urban development and social vulnerability are discussed. During urbanization, there are evident differences of SVI between urban and rural areas. Urbanization can help city districts reduce social vulnerability, while creating more social vulnerability in the coastal counties. For the districts, more adjustment strategies and work should be applied in the dimension of exposure during urbanization. For the counties, the prominent problem to be faced is an increase in sensitivity. © 2017 by the authors."
"Rating the sustainable city: ‘Measurementality’, transparency, and unexpected outcomes at the knowledge-policy interface","2018","10.1016/j.envsci.2017.10.006","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85032171872&doi=10.1016%2fj.envsci.2017.10.006&partnerID=40&md5=c18932f02ba65c7914a40a7117979cba","Ratings are an increasingly popular part of urban sustainability governance and are widely understood as tools to guide policy and ensure transparency. This understanding is part of a more general shift in governance towards “New Public Management” that emphasizes public accountability and the accuracy of quantitative metrics and technical knowledge in policy evaluation. But critics have assessed ratings as broader mechanisms of governmentality, through which authorities shape, instrumentalize, and control conduct, and promote particular urban trajectories, in politicized ways. This paper examines STAR Communities, a recently developed urban sustainability rating system in the USA, to understand how such ratings behave at the interface of knowledge and policy, and how seeking transparency through ratings can produce unexpected outcomes that evade sustainability. This paper is not a critique of a specific rating system or set of indicators, but does yield a critique of the kinds of unexpected outcomes that are possible when we privilege quantitative measures of achievement. The study finds: 1) ratings are often used as labels rather than as policy inputs; 2) ratings can exacerbate existing inequalities and create new inequalities within and between municipalities because, while ratings can bring financial benefits, certification demands significant financial and political resources; and, 3) ratings can incentivize the realignment of governance priorities, as cities ‘grab’ points by pursuing quickly implemented, uncontroversial, and politically ‘safe’ policies and programs. The study also finds that sustainability managers continue to pursue quantitative sustainability measurement because of dominant assumptions that ‘counting is what counts’. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

Based on the Green (Resource) Brand Hexagon (GBH), the green brand attributes of Hong Kong were tested with two samples: inbound visitors (n = 396) and outsiders, most of whom had not visited Hong Kong (n = 235). The results show that visitors have more diversified determinants than outsiders, with safety, accessibility, and the aesthetic value of parks and landscapes in particular increasing respondents’ willingness to stay in Hong Kong. Outsiders perceive that a pleasant experience in physical spaces is primarily relevant to their willingness to stay in Hong Kong for seeking employment and education. However, green brand attributes play only a small part in the views of both respondent groups, indicating the presence of non-environmental factors in the decision to stay in a city. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

Cities contribute significantly to pollution, and the move to more, and larger, cities is increasing. The whole-of-life role of timber in future urban developments as a contributor to balance urban carbon emissions is considered here using a new concept of Urban Equilibrium. When applied to Auckland, New Zealand, as a case study, maximising the use of timber in future urban developments demonstrated that Auckland's target of a 40% carbon emissions reduction by 2040 could be achieved 20% faster than planned while still meeting the city's future growth needs. This strategy is complementary to, and easy to integrate with, other strategies and policies for greenhouse gas mitigation. However, the Urban Equilibrium concept is broader than this and can also be applied in other aspects relating to the sustainability of urban environments. Urban Equilibrium fosters a framework of urban governance that integrates environmental and social development agendas with economic development. This holistic approach takes into account the various effects that economic development can have, and re-defines the concept of growth to include a moral obligation to future generations. © 2016"

Nevertheless, without denying the efforts to create a real environmental culture, the economic and social problems like production decline and growing unemployment made public concern shift away to more immediately stressful issues such as real wages or job insecurity. Later on, in the post-accession period the Cohesion Policy created a more stimulating framework for dealing with the sustainable development objectives. In the current programme period, 2014–2020, in accordance with the “Europe 2020” Strategy, the sustainable growth is closely related to smart and inclusive growth within the strategic objective of the Cohesion Policy, offering each member state multiple instruments and funding opportunities for complying with sustainability criteria. They are particularly supportive for CEE countries, whose internal resources are below the required levels in this respect. This paper proposes a spotlight on the sustainability issues in CEE cities, considered development vehicles for the regions they belong to, and thus major participants in the efforts to promote economic growth and diminish interregional disparities. An evolutionary perspective is applied, aiming to reveal how these cities responded to sustainability requirements in both pre- and post-accession periods. In addition, we test the variance of green performance between different groups of CEE cities (Baltic, Central or East European cities; large, medium and small cities; growing, stagnating and declining cities). In the final part of the paper, a special emphasis is placed on the policies able to create synergies between smart specialization and sustainable development approaches. To this end, the paper investigates how sustainable and smart growth policies complement each other in supporting eco-innovation, eco-system services and resource efficiency at the city level in CEE countries. Meanwhile, the paper looks for those smart policy mixes that rationally combine knowledge-based investments in areas with competitive advantages and coherent support measures for a greener economy, as a pre-requisite for territorial cohesion and competitiveness in Europe. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

Massive human intervention in the tropical region contributes to loss of environmental integrity amplifying challenges like air pollution, deforestation, water scarcity, local extinction, and destruction of natural landscapes. To shape the international community's attitude toward economic, social, and environmental development regarding environmental integrity different methods- Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+), Clean Development Mechanism (CMD)-are introduced. However, these methods have some limitations along with opportunities. This paper reviewed and analyzed existing methods in order to promote environmental integrity in the rapidly growing urban settings. Based on the drawbacks of current methods a new Environmental Integrity Index (EII) is proposed where indicators are selected while considering social, economic, and environmental aspects. The index aims to combine data from field surveys, GIS and remote sensing, and economic and social analysis. We anticipate that this proposed index can support planning for sustainable cities by promoting environmental integrity and balancing biological and ecological components in a highly intricate urban system. © 2016 Shathy and Reza."

The analysis in this paper asks about the speed at which density as a sustainability policy can be implemented. The Greater Toronto Hamilton Area (GTHA) is used as a case study to measure how quickly existing areas could be densified to meet minimum transit supportive density thresholds. Almost 70% of existing residents live in neighborhoods with densities below minimum transit supportive densities. The findings show that increases in minimum densities could be attained roughly within the target time horizon of existing growth plans, but that these increases hinge on assumptions of continuing high growth rates. The sustainability of cities relies on a high 'velocity of density', a term proposed in the paper to refer to the speed at which density can be implemented. Density is often slowed or halted by local residents, which could prove problematic if sustainability objectives require speedy implementation, for instance to address climate change. Analysis of the velocity of density suggests that planning for sustainability, and climate change, in cities would benefit from considering a broader set of solutions to car dependence in existing low-density areas than changes to the density of the built form alone. © 2017 by the authors."

It explores the efficiency of an emerging energy system, Ubiquitous Energy Internet (simply called UE NET) Technology and its application in eco-cities as the new paradigm shift in energy generation and utilization towards achieving sustainable development. Published data on environment and energy indicators for example carbon emission intensity, energy consumption and the final project proposals of Qingdao Eco-park on the energy potential of UE NET were scientifically analyzed. Results indicate that UE NET technology system has a high power saving potential than any stand-alone energy generation options. Energy awareness enables new sets of interactive energy-saving behaviors where devices control their power state to meet user needs while minimizing energy use (Lanzisera et al., 2014). This assertion does not only support findings of this research in a broader perspective, but specifically calls for ""energy-integration"" that is not just new but very efficient.

This paper contributes to a new body of research that investigates the potential of cargo cycles to make city logistics more sustainable and explores ways to encourage their diffusion. The paper makes three key contributions. First, it develops a typology of cycle logistics based on a literature review and expert interviews in order to clarify definitions and terminology. Second, it identifies perception issues, lack of awareness and regulations as major barriers to wider implementation at city level based on snap-shot case studies. Third, it suggests a sustainable city logistics framework for urban governance, logistic operations and future research, to harness the potential of using cargo cycles for sustainable urban freight transport. The paper argues that local authorities have a key role to play in creating conditions that incentivise large logistic companies such as DHL, Hermes and TNT to integrate cargo cycles into their supply chain and hence drive a long-term modal shift. The findings of the paper are of interest to policy makers, urban logistic operators, research institutions and citizens as potential customers. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd."

The effects of the approach to the development of an eco-city and the fitting of its business activities to the local context are investigated. The analysis identifies four transforming antecedents of the development of an eco-city in Asia, which are (1) utilization of a national approach and policy, (2) the presence of a dedicated local public authority, (3) the continuous engagement of local citizens, and (4) an infusion of national capability and business activity. The transformational development of an eco-city in Asia seeks to create a new techno-social regime that is based on sustainable solutions, whereas their respective national capabilities must be emphasized with an eye to efficiency, economy, and effectiveness simultaneously. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd."

Activities and models within the collaborative economy enable access instead of ownership, encourage decentralised networks over centralised institutions, provide new models to unlock wealth and often do so to a wider group of stakeholders. They make use of idle assets and create new marketplaces. It seems there are numerous environmental savings and resource utilisation benefits that follow from wide-spread adoption of collaborative models. Moreover, there may be a flow of social benefits that come from engagement and enhancement of community spirit and belongingness. This paper will explore the concept of the collaborative economy and sharing cities as well as questions related to what cities stand to gain through the adoption of sharing initiatives, how a city can start promoting collaborative lifestyles and be used as platforms for sharing. © 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd."

We present a new eco-city evaluation method comprising an ecological vulnerability evaluation index system and an economic, social and environmental evaluation index system based on land use, economic development, social progress and environmental protection using spatial analysis technology (remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS)). We constructed an ecological vulnerability evaluation index system using a pressure-state-response (PSR) model and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) based on an ecological suitability index, landscape pattern index and land resource utilization degree index and comprehensively evaluated the ecological vulnerability condition using principal component analysis (PCA) and an expert scoring method. We established an economic, social and environmental evaluation index system using factor analysis. These index systems are associated with the GIS and the AHP, and Jiangsu Province was used as an example to verify the applicability and efficiency of the evaluation method. The results show the following. (1) The ecological vulnerability of Jiangsu is relatively low but unevenly distributed. The regions with slight, light and medium vulnerabilities comprised 79.49% of the total area. (2) Thirteen cities were divided into economic advantages type (Suzhou), environmental advantages type (Nanjing, Wuxi, Yangzhou, Zhenjiang and Taizhou), social security advantages type (Changzhou, Xuzhou and Nantong) and general type (Lianyungang, Huaian, Yancheng and Suqian). (3) The overall condition of the eco-cities was classified as middle or upper and was unevenly distributed. The eco-cities were divided into four categories and there was a gradually decreasing trend from southeast to northwest, resulting in a gradient from southern Jiangsu to middle Jiangsu and northern Jiangsu. Every city should be constructed on the basis of its weak points to achieve healthy and optimum development. The results indicated that the method is an efficient and practical process, which differs from existing methods, and makes extensive use of spatial information technology and can be widely applied to evaluate eco-cities."

In this paper, ten dimensions are suggested for defining ecological cities and an effort has been made to provide indicators to measure them. Many cities claim to be ecological cities, but there are no non-ambiguous definitions of ecological cities and few efforts have been made to measure to what extent the cities have achieved their goal. This paper considers the efforts of Beijing and Rotterdam to become more eco cities, using these dimensions. What can we learn from these experiences for developing the city of the future? In an illustrative effort to apply the suggested criteria, Rotterdam scored slightly better than Beijing. The latter city is facing more serious environmental problems and is willing to try more innovative solutions, while Rotterdam spends more money on prevention and CO2 reduction. © 2015, The Author(s)."

But in our cities today urban waterways and associated green spaces are often inflexibly planned, unattractive and poorly treated. Without the proper management of water systems and green structures there is no basis for long term sustainability. Traditional engineering fails most frequently in cities in arid regions that have the highest risks, yet most successful modern cities have, through an integrated approach, managed to keep and develop their blue-green infrastructures to their benefit. A new language and awareness regarding blue-green issues needs to be developed with holistic and integrated approaches to all planning processes and urban developments. Through a range of global case studies, Herbert Dreiseitl explores the need to develop blue-green understanding and expertise, to engage urban landscape professionals from the earliest stages of planning, and to adopt strategic policy-making tools and good governance structures including public engagement and societal development. © Henry Stewart Publications."

The Eco-city has emerged as an urban modernization concept that attempts to reframe urban development for sustainable outcomes, yet there have been several alterations and coining of new terminologies to describe an eco-city, mainly based of concepts and the design methodology and/or the purpose the city is to serve. Even though the eco-city concept and development profess to have some basic principles - dogma - mostly based on urban sustainability, the rapid changes in terminology in recent times calls the attention of many policy makers, investors, development promoters and stakeholders, as well as researchers alike. Beyond these corporate borders, are also the culture (people) and the environment that are influenced by (and interacts with) the eco-city. However, there is no widely accepted framework for assessing Eco-cities. Besides, the methods and outcomes of Eco-cities; and how these outcomes can be evaluated to determine the performance of Eco-cites remain unresolved. This paper presents a framework for assessing the performance of Eco-cities. It argues that due to the inherent differences in the culture, topography, climate, economy, infrastructural base, and technological advancement etc. of cities around the world, Eco-cities may embody distinct characteristics in the way they are understood and applied in different regions. Nonetheless, using a common benchmark across geographical regions, one can do performance assessment of Eco-cities, which can be basis for replication, accessibility, as well as serve as goal metrics. © 2016 L&H Scientific Publishing, LLC.

Urban agriculture (UA) has gained a prominent role in urban greening and food system diversification strategies alike. Despite that it is the preeminent form of food production in North American cities, residential gardening has received little scholarly attention. Moreover, research on the intra-urban variability of home gardens is sparse. In this paper, we use a mixed-methods approach to assess the scale and scope of residential gardens in Portland, Oregon, a metropolitan region renowned for its innovations in sustainability. Using a combination of mapping, spatial regression, and a mail survey, we compare residential UA and the characteristics and motivations of gardeners in two socioeconomically differentiated areas of Portland and one of its major suburbs. Results demonstrate that engagement in UA is differentiated along both spatial and socioeconomic lines, with more educated respondents engaging for environmental reasons and more lowincome respondents relying on their gardens for food security. We contextualize our findings within broader urban processes, e.g. reinvestment in the urban core and displacement of poverty to the periphery. For policymakers, our results suggest the need for sustainability messaging that is sensitive to a variety of motivations and that resonates with a diverse population. For a city to reach a broader population, it may need to reframe its sustainability goals in new ways, while attending to the structural constraints to food access that cannot be resolved through local food production alone. © 2015 Elsevier B.V."

Considering this, the present study critically investigated the current practices of municipal solid waste (MSW) management in Chandigarh using strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) approach for better policy options. Chandigarh city generates approximately 350 TPD of MSW; which comprises mainly of compostable organics (50-55%), inorganics (15-20%) and inert (19-23%) fraction. The unprocessedMSWhas calorific value of 1547 kcal kg with average moisture content of 50%. The moisture content of the MSW varied significantly in different socio-economic groups including amount of waste generated and its chemical composition (e.g. C, H, N and S). SWOT analysis of MSW management practices highlighted that a single technology (such as refuse drive fuel, RDF) is not effective for complete management of various solid wastes, and hence city specific combination of technologies (e.g. Bio-methanation plant, composting / vermi-composting and recycling unit) should be adopted for sustainable waste management and to reduce its adverse impact. Further, findings of SWOT approach could help in developing a strategic action plans for sustainable cities involving community, private sector and municipal authorities. © Triveni Enterprises, Lucknow (India)."

As cities and towns are growing in size, sources of developable land are decreasing rapidly. This concept of land as a scare resource has prompted planners to introduce the concept of sustainability in their science in an attempt to better accommodate the needs of current and future population. In most countries, land use planning is a function of same level of government responsible for the delivery of services such as water, sanitation, electricity etc. Local government in turn place a value on land and collect rates and taxes in attempt to fund the provision of service. In many instances, however, the activities of land use planning, infrastructure provision and municipal finance are not integrated. This leads to inefficient cities and towns that are rapidly developing in a financially unsustainable manner. Planning legislation in South Africa has changed in the last year – with far reaching consequences for South African cities and towns.

Technologies themselves tend to be treated like black-boxes, somehow exogenously defined by engineering R&D efforts, while societies are mainly conceived of as passive agents, which can, at most, accept or reject them on the basis of their preferences. In our paper we adopt a different perspective, i.e., we start from the acknowledgement of the importance of the work of many distributed agents and micro-learning processes in technological evolutions and innovations as well as from the idea that sustainable solutions are by no means restricted to linear progression from past to future, as they can also encompass returns and recombinations of traditional components and practices together with new ones. After grounding our approach in some of the main contributions from innovation studies as well as in the application of cognitive science to evolutionary studies of technologies, we specifically discuss the possibility to use a multi-agent and multi-indexing ontological system as a device to share and learn technological knowledge across a wide community, thus supporting those micro-learning processes of distributed agents, which-in our perspective-can boost innovation and change in practice. In so doing, we will refer to a case study developed within the EU-funded project ANTINOMOS ""A knowledge network for solving real-life water problems in developing countries: bridging contrasts"", which has largely dealt with enhancement and management of local/community-based knowledge for water sector management. The major aim is to create an appropriate learning environment for sharing and for actively generating knowledge through multi-actor synergies.

Drawing on insights from actor-network theory and an empirical study of two Danish urban development competitions in which design teams were required to use a sustainability assessment tool, the analysis shows how this artefact mediated interaction among different professionals and initiated iterative, dialogical processes that affected building practices.

Sustainable development, a widely accepted strategic framework in city planning, singles out urban green spaces as a primary solution for addressing these issues. Growing empirical evidences indicate that the presence of natural areas contributes to a better quality of life in many ways. Urban green spaces serve as places of identity, memory, and belonging; enrich human life with meaning and emotions by providing important social and psychological benefits; and enhance the quality of life of citizens, which is a key component of sustainability. Despite our understanding of the benefits of urban green spaces, little is known about the benefits of historical urban green spaces. To highlight their importance with regard to environmental sustainability and citizens' well-being, this study analyzes a number of historical Persian gardens that are still actively used by urban residents. The findings suggest that historical Persian gardens could accommodate many social functions and address many of the psychological issues relating to urban dwelling. It has been generally acknowledged that sense of community and place attachment is pivotal to creating sustainable urban environments. Historical gardens as physical components can cohesively weave together many parts of cities of any cities while providing places for public congregation as well as attracting a variety of local economic activities.

Cities can only maintain their prosperity when environmental and social objectives are fully integrated with economic goals. Sustainability assessment helps policy-makers decide what actions they should and should not take to make our cities more sustainable. There are numerous models available for measuring and evaluating urban sustainability; they focus their analysis on a specific scale-i.e., micro, mezzo, or macro. In most cases, these results are inadequate for the other scales, though generating reliable results for that particular scale. The paper introduces a multiscalar urban sustainability approach by linking two sustainability assessment models evaluate sustainability performances in micro- and mezzo-levels and generate multiscalar results for the macro-level.

We investigated this development and conducted empirical research in Suzhou Industrial Park, to obtain insight in how a mature eco-industrial park influences if not leverages the development of an eco-city. To this end we inventoried and analyzed policy instruments and environmental infrastructures and deduced how in Suzhou Industrial Park these led to improved energy efficiency, reduced pollution and contributed to its eco-city development. Eco-efficiency and decoupling theory were used to evaluate the environmental performance relative to economic growth in Suzhou Industrial Park. Our results showed that relative de-coupling of environmental performance and economic growth was realized for most eco-efficiency indicators, while non-decoupling and absolute decoupling occurred incidentally. This was caused by the deployment of strict regulatory and economic instruments (such as stricter environmental entry rules and requirements on sulfur dioxide emissions). Moreover, the increasing share of tertiary industry, urban service and residential activities also lead to this result. Thus, the experience in Suzhou Industrial Park reveals that an eco-industrial park may evolve into an eco-city development when it leads to an improvement of its environmental performance and a growth of tertiary industry, develops synergies between its infrastructures for industrial and residential areas and enhances the economic prosperity derived from its industrial sites. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd."

Unfortunately, many cities do not have the space or resources to provide robust public transport systems, such as subways. We investigate moving walkways as another mode of transportation. To date, moving walkways have served a minor role in transportation and are typically located only within airports. The key challenge that we overcome is how to design and integrate variable speed moving walk-ways so that they become a fast mode of transport that can integrate with urban infrastructure to provide an alternative or supplement to systems such as busses and subways. We address how to safely control and operate such walkways. In comparison with existing forms of public transportation, this mode of transportation allows lower latencies with higher throughput by operating continuously and allowing acceleration and deceleration of passengers. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Policies that were based on economic growth along with rapid urban population increases in the 20th century irreversibly and negatively impacted most urban eco-systems globally. Climate changes began to occur mainly due to fossil carbon intensive technologies upon which the urban systems and lifestyles have co-evolved. Concepts such as sustainable development (SD) and ecological modernization (EM) were among the most discussed approaches with regard to ways of responding positively to the emerging environmental concerns induced by the growth policies and development strategies. In spite of some positive contributions to urban policies that resulted in relative successes, most notably in Northwest Europe, questions remained as to whether these concepts have effectively and sufficiently catalyzed the promotion of sustainable urban developments more broadly. By building this literature review, the authors explored the evolutionary aspects and the shortcomings of the EM and SD within the overarching sustainability paradigm. The review addressed the emerging theories developed to improve approaches to urban development policies and procedures, and to contextualize the evolution of regenerative or net positive developments in broader cultural, geographical and temporal contexts. The historically significant antecedents were reviewed and visions for needed transitions were outlined in this two-part series of review articles. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Yet, despite popular conceptions of the city as a progressive ecotopia and the accolades of planners seeking to emulate its innovations, Portlands sustainability successes are inequitably distributed. Drawing on census data, popular media, newspaper archives, city planning documents, and secondary source histories, we attempt to elucidate the structural origins of Portlands ""uneven development,"" exploring how and why the urban core of this paragon of sustainability has become more White and affluent while its outer eastside has become more diverse and poor. We explain how a ""sustainability fix""-in this case, green investment in the citys core-ultimately contributed to the demarcation of racialized poverty along 82nd Avenue, a major north-south arterial marking the boundary of East Portland. Our account of structural processes taking place at multiple scales contributes to a growing body of literature on eco-gentrification and displacement and inner-ring suburban change while empirically demonstrating how Portlands advances in sustainability have come at the cost of East Portlands devaluation. Our ""30,000 foot"" perspective reveals systemic patterns that might then guide more fine-grained analyses of particular political-socio-cultural processes, while providing cautionary insights into current efforts to extend the citys sustainability initiatives using the same green development model. © 2015 Taylor and Francis."

The ventilation environment of a city is dependent on its background wind environment and ventilation potential. The background wind environment can be assessed through meteorological statistical analyses or numerical simulations, whereas the ventilation potential can be estimated using the underlying surface dynamic roughness length (RL) and the surrounding sky view factor (SVF). Based on the principle of morphology, the RL of a vegetation area is determined mainly by the vegetation types, vegetation canopy area index and vegetation height, whereas the RL of an urban area is defined mainly by the building area coverage and building height. The SVF can be estimated according to high-resolution digital raster elevation data. Based on the combination of the RL and SVF, the ventilation potential is graded, and the ventilation potential index (VPI) is defined and used to assess quantitatively the ventilation capacity of the city. The present study calculates the RL of the Yanqi Lake Eco-city using Landsat-TM5 satellite data from 26 July 2011, Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) satellite data from 2005 and Beijing basic geographical data at 1:2000 from 2009. Subsequently, the RL and ventilation potential distribution of the Yanqi Lake Eco-city is mapped at a 100m spatial resolution. The ventilation conditions before and after the construction of the Yanqi Lake Eco-city are evaluated using the VPI in combination with the background wind field. According to changes in the ventilation capacity, relevant policy suggestions for urban buildings and design factors for ventilated corridors are postulated. © 2016 Royal Meteorological Society."

However, to advance urban ecological science and its application to sustainable urban transformations, key existing frameworks must be synthesized. This paper is a conceptual synthesis cast in essay form in order to encompass a broad range of relevant ideas. It starts from the premise that the familiar models of metropolitan and megalopolitan urban structure, of industrially driven urban development, and of the contrasts between urban and non‐urban lands are manifestly inadequate representations of evolving global reality. Such inadequacy is illustrated with examples from the United States and from China. Both the form and the interactions involved in contemporary urbanization and urban change suggest the need for a new integrated framework synthesizing two existing yet still evolving concepts: (1) The urban megaregion framework accommodates the spatial extent, interdigitation of contrasting land uses, and the linked spatial relations between nominally urban and nominally rural areas. (2) The new concept of the continuum of urbanity emphasizes the shifts in livelihood and lifestyle driven by regional and global teleconnections and their joint effects on local environments and landscapes. Together these frameworks suggest a common conceptual structure for addressing urban areas of different ages, sizes, forms, and dynamics in both urbanizing and urbanized areas in developing and developed countries and regions. The synthesis of frameworks points to empirical research needs, and has the potential to better match sustainability plans and actions with the diverse urban forms and dynamics now appearing around the world. © 2015, © 2015 Pickett and Zhou."

Independently, the concept of 'sustainable cities' had emerged earlier, with many successful implementations already underway. I propose to define a sustainable city as one able to feed and power itself as much as possible using land and energy efficiently with the least environmental pollution and impact on climate change, minimizing wastes and recycling and reconverting wastes into resources. Coherent fractal space-time structures are the key to a circular thermodynamics of organisms and sustainable systems that achieves the state of minimum entropy production and dissipation that Ilya Prigogine had proposed as a conjecture.

Results of this study show that diversity patterns differ depending on the taxonomic group; thus, it was not possible to generalize specific trends in species richness, abundance, and species composition because each taxon seems to respond differently to the process or level of urbanization. Our results also highlight the relevance of using multi-taxonomic approaches to understand the relationship between biodiversity and urban environments, and underline potential benefits and limitations of using each of the studied groups when considering rapid biodiversity assessments. Based on our results, we suggest the following recommendations when performing rapid biological assessments in urban areas: evaluate as many taxa as possible, choosing the set of taxonomic groups in relation to the objectives of the study, wide the temporal and spatial survey window as much as possible, focus on several biodiversity measures, and interpreting results cautiously, as rapid assessments do not necessarily reflect ecological patterns, but just part of the history. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

Historically, some aspects of advancing the urban way of life have not been considered important in city planning. This is particularly the case where technological advances have led to conflicting land use, as with the installation of power poles and building electrical substations near residential areas. This research aims to discuss and rethink sustainability in cities, focusing on the environmental impact of low-frequency noise and electromagnetic radiation on human health. It presents data from a case study in an urban space in northern Portugal, and focuses on four guiding questions: Can power poles and power lines cause noise? Do power poles and power lines cause discomfort? Do power poles and power lines cause discomfort due to noise? Can power poles and power lines affect human health? To answer these questions, we undertook research between 2014 and 2015 that was comprised of two approaches. The first approach consisted of evaluating the noise of nine points divided into two groups ""near the source"" (e.g., up to 50 m from power poles) and ""away from the source"" (e.g., more than 250 m away from the source). In the second approach, noise levels were measured for 72 h in houses located up to 20 m from the source. The groups consist of residents living within the distance range specified for each group. The measurement values were compared with the proposed criteria for assessing low-frequency noise using the DEFRA Guidance (University of Salford). In the first approach, the noise caused discomfort, regardless of the group. In the second approach, the noise had fluctuating characteristics, which led us to conclude that the noise caused discomfort. © 2015 by the authors."

Moreover, it aims to explore the benefits of ES to organizations and to relate these benefits to the ES adoption in future sustainable city settings. Future cities will have micro-industries requiring dynamic interactions and will be dependent on efficient supply chains. The recent developments in information and communications technology (ICT) such as cloud computing through its dynamic, on-demand and service-based delivery are making it possible to achieve those goals for supply chains. The ES in general and more specifically SCMS have integrated organizations into one seamless mesh. Design/methodology/approach – This paper presents a framework for adoption of sustainable ES in a smart city setting. The framework, firstly, is presented at a macro-level, particularly incorporating the relative significance of motivational factors for sustainable ES adoption. Subsequently, The authors study the benefits of ES as perceived by large and small and medium enterprise (SME) organizations using 100 case studies and discuss how these benefits can be realized for smart cities by projecting the ES benefits onto the proposed framework. The benefits are estimated with the Shang and Seddon’s (2002) framework. Findings – The adoption of ES initiated with environmental factors and mediated with business and technical factors will bring benefits in all the dimensions of triple bottom line in addition to the firm’s performance. ES will have pivotal role in future smart city settings and will be able to offer social, environmental and economic sustainability in addition to traditional organizational performance indicators. Originality/value – The proposed framework for ES adoption will bring ES packages (particularly, the required relative significance of adoption reasons) into the perspective of sustainable development. Moreover, the study of its benefits in relation to the proposed sustainable ES adoption framework presented in this paper will help in motivating organizations to incorporate social, economic and environmental sustainability into their core business objectives. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

A number of papers in Chinese journals attribute this slogan to the government's revival of the Confucian ecological vision, combined with western technology. This paper first compares the concept of nature in these mega eco-cities and the Confucian concept of tianrenheyi, the unity of Heaven and Humanity, suggesting that the human-nature relationship in eco-cities is essentially a consumer-commodity relationship, which is void of the sacredness or moral association of the human-nature relationship in the unity of HeavenandHumanity. Secondly, drawing on the theory of ecology and interconnected systems and noting that the failure of eco-city projects lies in the separation of the eco-city from the city itself, I suggest that the eco-city's approach of taking nature as a guinea pig of technology in a ""vacuum space"" is quite opposite to the Confucian idea of the unity of Heaven and Humanity which emphasizes the interconnectedness of all inorganic and organic forms. In conclusion, I evoke Wang Shu's practice of sustainable architecture to illustrate a more authentic, up-to-date interpretation of the Confucian ecological vision-investigating the relational reality, developing one's moral nature and cultural intuition. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd."

It is critical for decision-makers to raise the appropriate urban development strategies so that cities can move toward sustainable development. In this regard, well-designed evaluation methods are valuable for managing environmental development and providing guidelines to improve sustainable urban development. Six well-known assessment methods for environment and sustainability assessment, namely, input-output analysis (IOA), life-cycle analysis (LCA), ecological footprint (EF), carbon footprint (CF), emergy analysis and cost benefit analysis are selected. Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages. This paper provides a comprehensive literature review on these methods and proposes an integration of different methods so that the holistic performance of one eco-city initiative can be scientifically evaluated and key problems can be identified. Such an integration can solve the problems that each single method is facing so that valuable policy insights can be identified for urban decision-makers to prepare more appropriate urban strategies. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus, many studies have been conducted to define sustainability and the sustainable city. However, many of these definitions suggest a range of contradictions, implying that the achievement of sustainability is elusive. The problem lies in setting unreasonable definitions of sustainability and in the various contradictions to these definitions, making sustainability seemingly unattainable. Hence, some models of cities are emerging that are labeled as sustainable cities; among these are the “zero-carbon city” and the “ubiquitous eco-city” (“U-eco-city”). This study reviews the history and definitions of sustainability, in order to acknowledge the contradictions inherent in these concepts. It also briefly presents the compact city, the zero-carbon eco-city, and the U-eco-city by determining their individual pros and cons and highlighting where there are any conflicts with the principles of sustainability. The aim of the study was to adjust the use of sustainability as a terminology in the field of urban sustainable development and to demonstrate the extent to which we use marketing names for eco-cities without compliance with sustainable dimensions. The study will also discuss the key sustainability pillar required for a project to be kept sustainable. The study concludes that the use of the term “sustainable city” may limit the potential for further enhancing sustainability in future projects; using the term “transition toward the sustainable city” may be more accurate and more effective. The results show that reducing energy consumption through efficient use, and relying on renewable energies, will be the keys to reaching urban sustainability. The study also finds that recent tyranny in the name of ecology will not result in real sustainability. Although the free eco-city and the u-eco-city are considered advanced models, their limitations are related more to the economic and social aspects than to the compact city, which clearly reflected the pillars of sustainability, despite its being an outdated model. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht."

It is a politics that makes a series of normative claims and promises based on a pragmatic and non-ideological approach to sustainability. Its advocates claim that it converts the lofty ideals and aspirations of utopian sustainability into tangible, verifiable and output-based delivery mechanisms. The discussion examines the governance arrangements that were put in place for the Games and the ways in which sustainability objectives were defined, institutionalised and mobilised by hybrid public and private actors. It outlines some of the wider impacts of this new development model and its implications for thinking about sustainability planning elsewhere. © 2014 The Author.

For example, the use of electrochemical sensors for monitoring urban air quality allows the deployment of multi-scale high-density air quality sensor networks at fine spatial and temporal scales, and in both static and mobile configurations, pushing the boundary of traditional environmental and urban studies. In addition, deploying diffuse biosensors to measure qualitatively and quantitatively specific behavior from communities (i.e. biomarkers) might foster a completely new approach to the study of cities and their urban environment, people, and technology. The paper will therefore present a systematic review of previous studies on micro and nano-sensors applied to the smart city concept and projects, stressing challenges and positive outcomes. Monitoring for surveillance, urban management, knowledge support for assessment, and decision making processes are the main features potentially enhanced by the use of sensors for the smart and sustainable city, and starting from the different experiences analyzed, the paper will discuss how sensors are currently changing the way cities are studied and managed.

The case of the City of Vancouver’s Greenest City Action Plan (GCAP) (2010–2020) is investigated as a window to perceive and understand this shift. We begin with the stance that the primary implications of a shift from sustainability to climate change policy are in social and institutional learning about action, and as such we adopt an urban knowledge order framework for our analysis. At the organizational scale, we investigate the implications of GCAP in terms of its impact on the city structure and organization, in terms of the way it works with the public and with external organizations in designing and implementing policy, and in terms of reporting and accountability. An understanding of the construction of an urban knowledge arena as a valuable process and outcome of sustainability and climate policy work offers a pragmatic way to integrate and promote sustainability thinking across the city administration, amongst citizen-participants, and in collaboration with external partners. We see in the City of Vancouver an ecologically modernizing city, which is also learning a new, partnership-based way of wielding power and coordinating and justifying sustainability and climate change policy and action. © 2015 Taylor & Francis."

This is achieved by adopting the literature review methodology for the study. The paper first reviewed the previous studies that are serving as the theoretical framework underpinning the HECCE models. Further to this, the paper identified an array of energy models that have evolved over the years together with their capability of analysing energy consumption and their associated carbon emission trends in housing sector of the economy. The results of the study showed that econometric (mainly top-down), building physics, and statistical (mainly bottom-up) methods are the existing approaches that have found application in modelling HECCE issues. However, a number of limitations were noticed in these existing modelling techniques. These are (1) lack of transparency in the model algorithms, (2) inability to account for the complex, interdependencies, and dynamic nature of the issue of energy consumption and carbon emissions, (3) limited evidence to show for the occupants–dwelling interactions, and (4) lack of enough capacity to accommodate qualitative data input. And as such, the study concluded that there is the need to scout for more robust and sophisticated modelling approaches that take into consideration the kind of complexity involved in issues relating to HECCE. © 2015"

An ironical tool that has shaped our cities to grow in an organic way impeding its definitive/ structural growth is the ""slum"". I term it as an ""Infotopia"" (Informal Utopia) that is in itself a genesis of the people. Over the years the growth of infotopia has been unprecedented. A search for a place to dwell, a shed to work and food to eat is the agenda in most minds considering migration. With such dynamics as the foundation, there has been an efficient way these utopias practice conventional way of living. This efficiency exhibited leads to economic as well social sustainability. Based on the study, the cases revealed the efficiency of spatial typology, communal living, pattern and morphology of settlement and inefficiency in sanitation and hygiene systems. This would be contrasted by exploring master plans of another high density living, of a similar scale that includes innovative technologies and an introverted way of living. The high investment cost in the settlement would do nothing more than being socially non viable, provide encouragement to the private domain and cultivate the lack of a sense of belonging. The paper focuses on an argument that ""a need"" in human settlements is directly proportional to the amount of sustainability they illustrate. It demonstrates how people in informal utopias adapt to crisises and move in search of an environment that is socially and economically sustainable as well. The cases will be explored based on the authors experience in these utopias in the third world. The conclusion would be suggestive on policies that include economic and social viability in such newly formed settlements (master plans). It focuses on how the emergent and fast building technologies could compliment the traditional ways practiced in infotopias for the betterment of their livelihoods. However, one has to keep in mind, ""Where there is a need, there will always be greed"". Our present scenario in developing cities is dealing with environments where there are huge housing deficits in the deprived areas. When smarter technology is added on to the traditional ways of living, the investments required become lower, thus facilitating economically viable environments. This is best concluded in the statement,"" If you don't provide them an environment to live and an economy to sustain, then where is the question of environmental and ecological sustainability?"" © 2015, Associated Cement Companies Ltd.

In this article, we examine one local sustainability plan, Philadelphia’s Greenworks, through a city-based, rather than per capita-based, ecological footprint (EF) analysis. Our objective is to theoretically establish the extent to which at least one of the items in Greenworks—to have 20% of the city’s electricity come from alternative energy sources—might reduce Philadelphia’s overall energy footprint if imple-mented within the municipal boundaries. By moving away from the idea that per capita energy footprints add up to a citywide energy footprint, we posit that a city can reduce its overall energy footprint by utilizing internal resources, even if the total land used for that respective energy were to increase. For many cities this will result in the use of renewables, such as solar, biogas, wind, hydropower, geothermal, and other creative solutions. By extending at least one component of Philadelphia’s sustainability plan through EF analysis, we provide a hypothetical example of how municipal sustainability goals might contribute to a larger goal of urban sustainability, at least in the limited sense that they become less reliant on outlying resources. © 2014 Moscovici et al.

Compact city policy implies urban densification, sometimes with elimination of green space. Citizen's valuable arguments in urban densification developments in green space are easily ignored, as is explored in a case study in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Place making decisions are more often legitimized with sustainability claims, and arguments from less convinced residents are denied or remain unexamined. About green space these also concern environmental qualities significant for long term sustainability of cities. This is illustrated by presenting empirical evidence about environmental education, an argument emerging from the explorative study. Environmental education should be seen as an important element in longterm sustainability, but the educational relevance of proximity of green space to schools had remained unknown. Empirical evidence of the negative effect of larger distances to green space on environmental education is presented in a geographical survey. The results suggest that close proximity to urban green space also reinforces fieldwork activities further away. As the validity of this argument was denied in the case study, this illustrates the need to establish frameworks that foster recognition and learning in open processes in urban densification. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd."

The eco and low-carbon indicator tool for evaluating cities (ELITE cities) was developed by researchers at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in 2012 to evaluate cities' performance by comparing them against benchmark performance goals as well as rank them against other cities in China. ELITE cities measures progress on 33 key indicators selected to represent priority issues within eight primary categories. An excel-based tool was then developed to package the key indicators, indicator benchmarks, explanation of indicators, point calculation functions and transparency-oriented data recording instructions. ELITE cities could be a useful and effective tool for local city government in defining the broad outlines of a low-carbon eco-city and assessing the progress of cities' efforts towards this goal.

In particular, the potential capacity of China's new socio-technical regime, built on eco-cities, is based on its capability to (1) create a vision for a smart energy system; (2) drive down the cost of renewable energy equipment and devices; (3) support local industrial clusters for socio-economic development; (4) implement effective policies for city-level solutions; and (5) standardize and replicate these strategies in the new regime as a whole.

So we investigate in this paper how they could share a rapid transit network and use the available transportation capacity within a city more efficiently in an interconnected way. Based on the common characteristics of personal rapid transit (PRT) and freight rapid transit (FRT), this paper proposes an emergent and efficient transportation solution in order to enhance the sustainability of city logistics. Next, the operational level is focused on to characterize the dynamic transportation problem and to propose two strategies to formulate it. This problem aims to respond to the number of transportation requests arriving on a periodic basis with adequate service level while minimizing the empty movements of a set of electric vehicles with limited battery capacity. An efficient solution approach based on the forward optimization of periodic transportation sub-problems is proposed and validated. The applicability of the PRT-FRT mode is demonstrated and computational results in comparison to other transportation option is also presented and discussed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd."

There is the contention that people living in cities have become disconnected with food production, leading to reduced nutrition in diets and increased food waste. Integrating food production into cities (urban agriculture) can help alleviate some of these issues. Lack of space at ground level in high-density urban areas has accelerated the idea of using spare building surfaces for food production. There are various growing methods being used for food production on buildings, which can be split into two main types, soil-less systems and soil-based systems. This paper is a holistic assessment (underpinned by the triple bottom line of sustainable development) of these two types of systems for food production on buildings, looking at the benefits and limitation of each type in this context. The results illustrate that soil-less systems are more productive per square metre, which increases the amount of locally grown, fresh produce available in urban areas. The results also show that soil-based systems for cultivation on buildings are more environmentally and socially beneficial overall for urban areas than soil-less systems."
"3D evaluation model of eco-city planning based on the distance measure","2016","","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85013342246&partnerID=40&md5=1f748fbcfb58570790efe3406b9fb68e","With high-speed urbanization and strict requirements on energy conservation and environmental protection, eco-city has become the priority of urban development in China. Governments of all levels promote various eco-city planning schemes within a short term, but most schemes are characterized by randomness and subjectivity. To solve the lack of scientific pre-implementation evaluation for eco-city planning and improve eco-city construction quality, a systematic analysis is conducted in this study from three dimensions, namely, eco-city planning scheme, operating mechanism, and guarantee measures. A 3D evaluation model for eco-city planning is constructed through index selection. Schemes are ranked comprehensively with the distance measure method, and projection analysis is performed with the four-grid evaluation screen. Finally, the 3D evaluation model is applied to evaluate eco-city planning for Shenzhen, Chongqing, and Weifang. Results show that the model can be used to evaluate eco-city planning schemes effectively and comprehensively and offers targeted optimization suggestions in accordance with the evaluation results. Construction of the 3D evaluation model of eco-city planning based on the distance measure to determine the reasonability of eco-city planning reduces the institutional and social costs of eco-city planning practices."

There is currently a massive growth in urban areas internationally, especially in developing countries. Urban centers and cities should offer an effective answer to new problems arising from planning and expansion, according to criteria of sustainability. Decisions for sustainable cities planning and management should be taken on an evaluation of their consequences. Correspondingly, each strategy should be designed and undertaken with the right tools of study, analysis and prediction. This paper aims to offer an analysis of the aspects involved in designing sustainable cities. It involves an overview of published papers focusing on urban transport, building energy consumption, green areas planning, waste management and water supply on a city-wide scale. In order to give a broader concept of sustainability in cities, an analysis of other variables from a social point of view is also given. The discussion of this research reflects that the adoption of mechanisms to promote sustainable development is a matter not only of decision makers and designers, but also of users and citizens. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

A variety of hazards threaten cities; thus, planning for resilience in the face of urban disaster is important. We are just beginning to realize the scope and magnitude of the challenges inherent in making our cities resilient to threats from natural hazards and terrorism. To meet these challenges, a national resilient-cities initiative aims at the vision of the resilient city as the goal that covers all types of hazard mitigation. To succeed, this initiative will require changes in national disaster policy, funding for urban systems research, support for advanced education program, and active collaboration among the city professions. One of the natural hazards to which cities should be resilient is drought that is resulted from climate change. The city of Mashhad, which has faced water crisis in recent years, is selected as a case study. By analyzing the status of water resources and their changes during the periods of growth and development of the city, its function in resilience and sustainability is measured.

Hence the Chinese government has been taking vigorous efforts in developing eco-cities across the nation to pursue sustainable development. This study reviews the development of the eco-city framework of the national government of China, and investigates the quality of Chinese eco-cities through an international case-study comparative analysis. The two cases, Suzhou (China) and Kitakyushu (Japan) are both honored as the best practice of eco-cities in their respective countries. The comparative analysis uses 19 indicators of the Chinese national eco-city framework. Results show that Suzhou has made remarkable progress in green space creation and environmental infrastructure construction. However, huge gaps in various indicators, especially the environmental quality performances, reveal the poor levels of pollution in Chinese cities, even in the so-called eco-cities. The rural-urban disparity and the energy consumption efficiency also call for more attention. Recommendations are made for the eco-city framework including raising the environmental standards, setting up a re-examination system in order to ensure the environmental quality, incorporating indicators related to waste recycling, and designing a new set of indicators for the social aspect. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd."

Groundwater is a particular concern as it represents over 95 % of the world’s available fresh water reserves and supplies over 1.5 billion city dwellers with water essential for their drinking and sanitation needs. Within 20 years, the global population is projected to rise from 7 billion to 8 billion with this entire growth accommodated in urban areas. Much of the additional water required will be sought from groundwater due to the generally modest cost of waterwells and the close, “well’s length” proximity of the resource. Fortunately, significant progress has been made in the science of urban groundwater during the past 25 years, most notably with respect to the nature of urban recharge and components of the urban water balance, contaminant source characterisation, recharge management and methods of assessing aquifer vulnerability. There have also been major advances in the development and use of advanced ground and surface water modelling tools, some of which are linked with GIS and urban databanks to provide unprecedented support for resource management decision making. What is missing are appropriate systems of urban water governance that are essential for effective and responsible groundwater resource management. Despite the growing popularity of “integrated water resource management” models that promote urban water management in a comprehensive, holistic, way, it is not clear that such techniques adequately incorporate the unique storage and flow attributes of groundwater, behaviours that merit special management considerations. Today, a significantly increased awareness for the valuable role of groundwater in the urban water cycle is beginning to raise its profile at the political level. Improved groundwater governance with the full involvement of all stakeholders in the decision-making process is now recognised as the key to resolve sustainability concerns over water in the world’s rapidly growing cities. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

Therefore, evaluation of existing compactness and sustainability of an area is an essential task before the real development takes place. In the literature, it is possible to see some studies on city’s compactness assessment and most of them have considered only a few aspects of compact development analysis. This paper aims to analyse urban sustainability of Kajang city (Malaysia) through a comprehensive city compactness assessment using geographical information system and radar remote sensing technology. To measure building density, a RADAR image of the study area was used to extract built-up areas with the aid of pixel-based and object-based classification schemes. Mixed land use development, urban density and intensity were the main indicators of the analysis. Finally, multicriteria decision-making and Bayes theorems were applied for overall compactness assessment. Building density analysis was validated using standard confusion matrix, which showed more than 90% accuracy. Similarly, the root-mean squared error showed 0.35 for object-based classification. The results classified the zones of the Kajang city in the range of least to most compact zones with the compactness value of 0.00273–0.0146, respectively. The results obtained in this study can help local government to improve the compactness of least compact zones to make Kajang city more sustainable. Furthermore, the results revealed that efficient public transportation and proper community facilities are the key factors to achieve sustainable urban development. © 2014, Taylor & Francis."

Considering this, it is very important to study the causes of city problems and to develop city models implementing sustainability practices. There are a limited number of studies developing sustainable city models, but in the scientific community there is an even greater lack of studies about the rehabilitation of current cities to implement these models. This work emerges with the objective of analysing how it is possible to implement sustainability practices in cities through the development of a sustainable city model and an urban rehabilitation plan. The development of sustainable city models is a very complex topic and the analysis of the literature shows that it is necessary to consider the relation between environmental and social aspects in the development of sustainable cities, while taking special care when considering the economic issues. It was also concluded that sustainable city models and rehabilitation plans should be subject to sustainability assessments and should consider the active participation of the city inhabitants. In fact, a city can only be sustainable if its population is in harmony with the city model and we can only assess results by predicting and measuring performance levels. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis."

We introduced the theoretical basis of circular economy and eco-city; analyzed the current situation of Wafangdian from the aspects of economy, environment, and society; and established the eco-city index evaluation system based on circular economy. We also employed principal component analysis to confirm the weighting of each index, evaluated the economic situation of Wafangdian using the sum of the weightings, analyzed the economic development status of the city from 2011 to 2015, and identified the advantages and disadvantages to the cycle of economic development in Wafangdian. Finally, we provided several suggestions on the circular economy in the construction of the Wafangdian eco-city from large, medium, and small hierarchies. Practices have shown that research on the planning framework of the circular economy eco-city has a positive effect on the sustainable development of humans and nature."

C., Leitner H. and Sheppard E. A green leap forward? Eco-state restructuring and the Tianjin–Binhai eco-city model. Regional Studies. China has experienced a remarkable explosion of designated eco-cities since the year 2000, with Tianjin–Binhai becoming the best-practice model. Embedded in broader political economic changes, shifting multi-scalar regimes of environmental governance have shaped this efflorescence. Applying eco-state restructuring, this paper argues that eco-city construction became a new strategic project after the 2000s, driven by central state-driven model cities and assessment initiatives. This also led to a very different kind of ‘best practice’ eco-city model: Tianjin–Binhai, a China–Singapore collaboration in which greenness is manufactured rather than adapted. Notwithstanding significant implementation problems, Tianjin–Binhai's status as best practice persists, raising questions about what it means to claim eco-city status. © 2016 The Author(s).

Built from scratch across an area of 74 km2, with an expected population of 800,000 by 2020, the city's plan boasts an abundance of urban sustainability features, from integrated public transport services and advanced water and waste recycling systems, to public parks and an extensive wetland area. This article uses the historical and conceptual perspective of ""techno-city"" to analyze the city's urban technology features. It highlights the relationship between the city and its hinterland, discusses the focus on science and technology driving the city's concept, and explores the international, modernist design language used. In doing so, the analysis points to several key tensions and contradictions at work, including a disconnect between the city's green technology focus and the high-carbon heavy industry of the surrounding area, and a lack of engagement with the local culture and community. Caofeidian Eco-City exhibits several features of twentieth-century techno-cities, although these are re-cast within the twenty-first-century context of global climate change policy and China's ongoing rapid urbanization processes. © 2013 Copyright The Society of Urban Technology."
"Sinners, scapegoats or fashion victims? Understanding the deaths of trees in the green city","2013","10.1016/j.geoforum.2013.04.018","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84878156115&doi=10.1016%2fj.geoforum.2013.04.018&partnerID=40&md5=a25c1e86a093ad4de8270f7aac24bda8","The emergence of urban green governance has given prominence to the role of trees in sustainable cities. Earlier ideas of trees as urban adornment and providers of amenity are giving way to understanding of the urban forest as green infrastructure. Urban trees are taking on the normative resonance of 'nature' previously reserved in sustainability discourse for nonurban environments. Yet a governing consensus that urban trees are good is not necessarily accepted by all. Despite extensive research on tree benefits, little is known about social resistance to urban trees. In Australia, anecdotal evidence suggests that many tree lovers perceive a countervailing force of tree haters who are responsible for tree injury and death through acts of revenge, scapegoating, displaced emotion and sheer loathing. This perception frames dislike of trees as social deviance rather than as a legitimate expression of complex intersubjective aspirations and concerns. In investigating the existence or otherwise of anti-arboreal forces, we report on a survey of residents in six eastern Australian cities that explored motivations underlying tree planting and removal. Rather than rejecting trees outright, most respondents expressing negative attitudes towards trees did so in the context of espousing the value of the 'right tree' in the 'right place'. The chief motivations for the removal of healthy trees were aesthetic and lifestyle preferences, linked to wider cultural dynamics of individuation and commodification, followed by moral considerations, linked to wider cultural dynamics related to nativism. The findings suggest that to reduce the turnover of private trees, advocates of the urban forest have to expand their engagement with residents beyond a current focus on technical discourses of tree services and regulatory controls. This expanded engagement needs to account for the full range of subjective factors that influence tree preferences. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd."

The emission of GHGs in the area of the case study is 371,270 tons, and the GHGs can be abated by 581,187 tons (or 134. 88%) suggesting that, in addition to 100% of the GHGs emitted, an additional 150,298 tons can also be reduced. The result of analyzing the amount of 4 each sectorial GHG emissions shows that 91% of total amount of GHG emission in the case area is by both of the sectors - ""Energy"" and ""Agriculture, Forestry and Land Use (AFOLU)"" out of 4 sectors. This result indicates that the GHGs reduction plan should be focused on these two sectors. The assessment method of this study can contribute to urban environmental planning to cope with climate change because it can provide a quantitative analysis of the effects that contribute to the Greenhouse Gases Reduction Target in development project areas. © 2013 Korean Society of Civil Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

Current oil strategies are geared to mitigation actions, but adaptive measures will become more important in the longer term future as oil supply becomes constrained. This paper reports the grounded theory research of a PhD investigation into adapting urban residential development to an oil-constrained future, in the Australian and wider context. The planning research is grounded in a general theoretical framework of sustainable development theory, encompassing urban metabolism and material flow analysis. European pre-oil economy cities form the basis for development of four grounded theories and a conceptual framework model about the characteristics of an oil-constrained sustainable city. The framework provides the basis of a tool for integrating the effects of oil constraints into the urban metabolism for sustainable planning and development. These theories and model will assist spatial planners to guide transformation of urban residential forms towards a transitional city of tomorrow and an oil-constrained city of the future. © 2014 WIT Press."

Differentiating between SD and ecological modernization (EM), we contend that even the weakest EM reforms prompt ecological restructuring (ER). Once unleashed, ER creates four problematics-ecological, economic, political and cultural-which governments at different scales must address by maintaining or challenging the status quo in relation to global structural imperatives; notably, requirements to promote economic growth and maintain legitimacy. That is, ER fosters uneven, non-linear processes of societal learning, which apply at different scales. Hence, where national governments lag behind, cities that develop 'action plans' may prompt SD. The framework is road tested by evaluating Vancouver's Greenest City Action Plan. We find that Vancouver does indeed push ER towards SD, especially in the political and cultural domains, even as Canada and British Columbia appear less committed. However, due to the proximity of city government to citizens' lived experiences of unsustainable development, Vancouver, like other cities, confronts a distinct kind of democratizing pressure. A future research agenda on this issue would aim to uncover how planning for SD must both foster and manage this democratizing pressure, which arises as informal (spontaneous, 'from below') participation meets formal (procedural, 'top-down') process. © 2013 Taylor & Francis."

Underlying this is a host of serious environmental problems resulting from growing urbanization, industrialization and motorization. Still, political realities dictate that economic growth figures cannot be compromised. Consequently, strong eco-city agendas are often combined with the wish to become knowledge cities. To import science and technology from abroad, collaboration is established between Chinese and foreign governments, corporations and knowledge institutes to develop cities with both ecological and knowledge features. This article aims to identify conditions for robust Sino-foreign partnerships in eco-cities. It examines how Sino-foreign initiatives are organized with their strengths and weaknesses and then construes a typology of Sino-foreign eco knowledge city initiatives. A newcomer on this stage, Shenzhen Sino-Dutch Low Carbon City, in which the authors have been personally involved as initiators and advisors, is then described in depth and compared with other Sino-foreign eco-knowledge cities in terms of its organizational stability, mechanisms for political support and the role of knowledge institutes. We conclude that initiatives where collaboration is embedded in solid frameworks of bi-national political support, public and private investment, advice and exchange are the most likely to succeed. Sino-Singaporean collaboration rests on stronger foundations than Sino-European collaboration, while among European, Swedish and Germans players at their turn have been more effective in building structural long-term relations than others."

A case study is selected and analyzed in order to find out the viable criteria for the correct management of the problem, aimed at a sustainable city and the decrease of human health effects. The role of conventional and unconventional pollutants (e.g. PM10 and ultrafine particles) is discussed. The available measurement strategies are analyzed in order to point out the trend of the sector and the gap to be covered for guaranteeing a homogeneous protection of the territory (every citizen has the right to inhale air of the same quality). The importance of not limiting the analysis to the implementation of emission inventories is demonstrable through simple examples: indeed data of global balances can mislead decision makers; they must guarantee an acceptable human exposure that depends on the amount of pollutant that effectively reaches each inhabitant. Location criteria for urban planning are proposed to prevent unacceptable human exposure cases (e.g. kindergarten should not be authorized near an urban freeway; construction of street canyons should be avoided). Zooming out the urban area helps to demonstrate that the coordination among cities is compulsory. To this concern, the transport of air pollutants from region to region must be taken into account. Unconventional emerging solutions for improving the air quality in urban areas are presented and discussed in the paper together with cost-related viability aspects. © 2014 WIT Press."

Eco-city projects are becoming increasingly prevalent in policy and political-economic discourses in a variety of locations as new urban spaces where blueprints for low carbon economies can be trialled. In light of this, the article highlights the key necessity of, firstly, considering scale when analyzing eco-city 'futures'. Secondly, the article argues for the need to interrogate eco-cities' definitions, as well as evaluation, performance and monitoring frameworks, as this will aid in critical analyses of the marketing, presentation and actually built urban environments in eco-city projects. Thirdly, the question of internal social resilience and the emergence of communities within newly-built eco-cities needs to be assessed: this is of crucial importance in light of the exclusive, gated nature of several flagship eco-city projects under construction at the time of writing. Lastly, the article argues that research on eco-city projects needs to consider not only the high-tech, new urban environments materialized as eco-cities, but also the production and reproduction of large, often transient populations of low-paid workers who build eco-cities and who form what the article calls the 'new urban poor', forming 'workers' cities' on the edges of flagship 'sustainable' urban projects worldwide. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd."

An idea on harnessing unnatural wind resources for electricity is presented. Two vertical axis wind turbines with an enclosure are mounted above a cooling tower to recover part of the energy from the exhaust air. Guide-vanes are designed to create a venturi effect and guide the wind before it interacts with the turbine blades. Diffuser-plates help to draw more wind and accelerate the exhaust airflow. Safety concerns that may result from blade failure are minimized by the design of the enclosure. From the laboratory test and field test results, there is no significant difference in the current consumption of the fan motor with the installation of the wind turbines. The integration of the enclosure has shown an improvement on the turbine's rotational speed which is 30.4% higher. The electricity generated from this system can be fed into the electricity grid. For 3000 units of cooling tower (2 m outlet diameter powered by a 7.5 kW fan motor and operated for 16 hours/day), 13% of the energy to power the fan motor is expected to be recovered from this system which equals 17.5 GWh/year. © 2013 Korean Society for Precision Engineering and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

Using a theoretical framework on input and output legitimacy with the City of Freiburg as the case, this article explores the political dimensions of the climate innovative city. The study shows that a specific kind of ""green conservative"" politics and a consensual view on climate issues across parties have been very important to creating political legitimacy. This has been supported by extraordinary and extensive citizen engagement in combination with the actual output, i.e. what environmental policies have delivered.

Such input energy can be defined after the structural system is specified and the input mechanism is described clearly. The energy input to structures consists mainly of the energy dissipated by hysteretic deformation and that by viscous damping. The excessive dependence on the former mechanism leads to unrepairable and unpreferable states of structures after earthquakes which should be avoided from the viewpoint of sustainability of building structures and cities. In this sense, the measure of energy is appropriate from the viewpoint of total management of buildings in a sustainable city. Then the upper bound of earthquake input energy is derived and discussed under uncertain conditions on input ground motions. It is shown that the earthquake energy input rate is another key parameter for measuring the instantaneous effect of earthquake ground motions on structural responses. A historical review is also made on the development of treatment of earthquake input energy into buildings and on its role into greater building earthquake resilience in sustainable cities. © 2014 Elsevier B.V."

From the technological point of view, guaranteeing ubiquitous connectivity, reliable communications and seamless integration of multiple network access technologies are mandatory in a smart city. This is in contrast with the current infrastructure deployment in several urban areas, which is characterised by lack of ubiquitous connectivity and coverage and by fragmentation of networks that are usually deployed by different operators and without any centralised control by the city authorities. In this paper, we look at the heterogeneity of devices and network technologies under a different perspective by not perceiving it as a limitation but as a potential to increase the connectivity in a smart city. We propose a new generation of network nodes, called stem nodes, based on the innovative idea of 'stemness', which pushes forward the well-known self-configuration and self-management concepts towards the idea of node mutation and evolution. We also deployed prototypes that demonstrate the stem-node architecture and basic operations in different hardware platforms of common communication devices (an Alix-based router, a laptop and a smartphone). © Copyright 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

Whereas the latter demands a 'culture of complexity' based on self-organized creativity as stipulation for a sustainable creative city, the former provides theories for analyzing unsustainable creative cities. By combining paradigms from critical urban sociology and cultural sustainability this article lays ground for understanding urban social movements by artists. On the one hand these movements resist unsustainable urban development; on the other hand they strive for opportunities that allow urban communities becoming creative sustainable neighborhoods. Lefebvre's 'Right to the City' concept, Molotch's 'growth machine' thesis, and Smith's elaboration of 'gentrification' are particularly suited to explain the unsustainable urban development of 'creative cities'. The contrasting term of 'cultural sustainability' combines ideas of 'sustainable creativity' with concepts of resilience and serendipity; here, urban development is not limited to mono-causal economic objectives. The theoretical considerations are illustrated by three case studies in Hamburg, Germany, a city with a neo-liberal, i.e., unsustainable, urban development strategy. The cases demonstrate ranges of crossovers of artistic, social and political objectives. They represent degrees of resilience against an unsustainable urban political economy with an unsustainable grasp on creativity. They also represent degrees of adaptation towards urban cultures of creative sustainability with needs of limiting growth, fostering social solidarity and shaping realms of creative possibilities. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd."

Montpellier has adopted such a vision, following the fundamental yet simple rule that eliminating or reducing the area of natural and agricultural land can no longer be regarded as the best path for urban development. The French national strategy of land use and urban planning has led to the creation of metropolitan regions, which are conceived as the strategic level at which sustainable urban development activities are planned. A range of communication tools to provide inhabitants with transparent and comprehensive information on the city's facts and figures has also been put in place over the past years. The Montpellier City Council even has a councilor for biodiversity, urban forests and the quality of public and green spaces to facilitate related policy decisions. The management and design of green spaces is the duty of a specific administrative unit, the Directorate of Landscape and Biodiversity."

The starting point was a citizens' movement emerged in 1978, which was consolidated in 1981 as the major political force when they obtained, for the first time, most of the seats on the City Council. This paper examines the driving forces behind the local project of sustainable development in Santa Monica. Also, it explains how the political platform that was effective to interpret the negotiation of social actors between the paradigms of urban competitiveness and sustainable development with social justice was structured. The general conclusion is that a sustainable city is a social construction in the midst of constant conflicts and negotiations, and that its success depends on the commitment of citizens and government institutions to make it possible. © EURE."

One entry point for understanding the variety of landscape characteristics associated with different forms of urbanization is through a characterization of vegetative (green) land covers. Green land covers-i.e., lawns, parks, forests-have been shown to have a variety of both positive and negative impacts on human and environmental outcomes-ranging from increasing property values, to mitigating urban heat islands, to increasing water use for outdoor watering purposes. While considerable research has examined the variation of vegetation distribution within cities and related social and economic drivers, we know very little about whether or how the economic characteristics and policy priorities of green cities differ from those of ""grey"" cities-those with little green land cover. To address this gap, this paper seeks to answer the question how do the economic characteristics and policy priorities of green and grey cities differ in the United States? To answer this question, MODIS data from 2001 to 2006 are used to characterize 373 US cities in terms of their vegetative greenness. Information from the International City/County Management Association's (ICMA) 2010 Local Government Sustainability Survey and 2009 Economic Development Survey are used to identify key governance strategies and policies that may differentiate green from grey cities. Two approaches for data analysis-ANOVA and decision tree analysis-are used to identify the most important characteristics for separating each category of city. The results indicate that grey cities tend to place a high priority on economic initiatives, while green cities place an emphasis on social justice, land conservation, and quality of life initiatives. © 2014 by the author."

We will not move toward a more sustainable society unless we accept that children are people with transportation needs, and 'bussing' them around, or providing parental limousine services at all times, will not lead to sustainability. Rather, we will need to make our cities walkable for children, at least those above a certain age. Safety has two main aspects, traffic safety and personal safety (risk of assault). Besides being safe, children will also need an urban environment with reasonable mobility, where they themselves can reach destinations with reasonable effort; else they will still need to be driven. This paper presents the results of two expert questionnaires focusing on the potential safety and mobility benefits to child pedestrians of targeted types of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Five different types of functional requests for children were identified based on previous work. The first expert questionnaire was structured to collect expert opinions on which ITS solutions or devices would be, and why, the most relevant ones to satisfy the five different functional requests of child pedestrians. Based on the first questionnaire, fifteen problem areas were defined. In the second questionnaire, the experts ranked the fifteen areas, and prioritized related ITS services, according to their potential for developing ITS services beneficial to children. Several ITS systems for improving pedestrian quality are discussed. ITS services can be used when a pedestrian route takes them to a dangerous street, dangerous crossing point or through a dangerous neighborhood. An improvement of safety and other qualities would lead to increased mobility and a more sustainable way of living. Children would learn how to live to support their own health and a sustainable city environment. But it will be up to national, regional and local governments, through their ministries and agencies and public works departments, to promote, fund, and possibly mandate such systems. It is clear that we need to offer an acceptable level of convenience, efficiency, comfort, safety and security to pedestrians but it is less clear if society will prioritize resources toward this. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Under these policy discourses, cities are designated as strategic geographical locales for fulfilling the green capitalist goal of reconciling the contradictions between the environment and development that have long bedeviled capitalism. While most urban sustainability agendas are crafted based on the experience of post-industrial countries, the promise of green capitalism and sustainability faces different challenges where industrial production still dominates the economy. However, research on whether and how urban sustainability policies are geographically variegated is still sparse, particularly beyond western (post)industrial capitalism. Examining the Dongtan eco-city project and the associated Chongming eco-island project in Shanghai, we interrogate how sustainability is imagined and practiced on the ground within the distinctive Chinese context. The meanings of sustainability in Dongtan and Chongming reflect the context of Chinese urbanization in the Shanghai area. Both Dongtan and Chongming seek to develop green technologies as a way to resolve the dilemma of being caught between urbanization and agriculture. This approach is also shaped by Chongming's island geography as enabling a self-sufficient development trajectory, and its desire to attract a cosmopolitan population. Through these place-specific contexts, the ecology and economy of Dongtan and Chongming become intertwined, producing and reproducing a variegated form of urban sustainability, and of ""green capitalism."". © 2013 Copyright The Society of Urban Technology."

The Blue-Green approach is more than a stormwater management strategy aimed at improving water quality and providing flood risk benefits. It can also provide important ecosystem services and socio-cultural benefits when the urban system is in a non-flood condition. However, quantitative evaluation of benefits and the appraisal of the relative significance of each benefit in a given location are not well understood. The Blue-Green Cities Research Project aims to develop procedures for the robust evaluation of the multiple functionalities of Blue-Green Infrastructure (BGI) components within flood risk management (FRM) strategies. The salient environmental challenge of FRM cuts across disciplinary boundaries, hence an interdisciplinary approach aims to avoid partial framing of the ongoing FRM debate. The Consortium, comprising academics from eight UK institutions and numerous disciplines, will investigate linkages between human behaviours and physical processes, and produce an urban flood model to simulate the movement of water and sediment through Blue-Green features. Individual and institutional agents will be incorporated into the model to illustrate how their behavioural changes impact on flooding and vice versa. A methodological approach for evaluating the interaction of urban FRM components within the wider urban system will be developed and highlight where, when and to whom a range of benefits may accrue from BGI and other flood management interventions under non-flood and flood conditions. Recognition of the compound uncertainties involved in achieving multiple benefits at scale will be part of the ongoing robust method of uncertainty evaluation. The deliverables will be applied to a chosen demonstration case study, Newcastle, UK, in the final year of the project (2015). This paper will introduce the Blue-Green Cities Research Project and the novel, interdisciplinary framework that is adopted to investigate multiple FRM benefits. © 2014 WIT Press."

Issues of non-sustainability are wicked problems that have many, often obscure causes, and for which there is no single, straightforward solution. Furthermore, the concept of sustainability is itself contested. For example there are disputes over whether a strong or weak interpretation of sustainability should be adopted. In cities, as elsewhere, sustainability therefore requires discursive plurality and multiple sites of action. It is the thesis of this paper that effective problem solving, decision-making and enacting of a sustainability agenda require deliberative collaborative governance (DCG), a logical hybrid of the closely related fields of deliberative democracy and collaborative governance. We provide a provisional typology of different modes of deliberative collaborative governance, explaining each with a sustainability example, with a particular focus on DCG initiatives for planning in Western Australia. It is argued that the lens provided by such a typology can help us to understand the factors likely to promote better resolution of wicked problems and increased sustainability. © 2013 by the authors."

It provided city administrations with an idea of where they stood vis-à-vis their European counterparts. However, while adopting such performance evaluation methodologies, it is important to set targets and goals, and to be aware of pitfalls that may exist in the course of a blind pursuit of a higher Green Score. City administrations are usually segmented into different divisions and departments; often each division strives towards its own set of targets and goals, without being aware (or without being concerned, even if it is aware) of the overlaps, conflicts and synergies that may exist with the targets and goals of the others. The Green City Index needs to be considered together with an Urban Socio-Economic Index, which can be suitably structured with the inter-linkages with the indicators of the Green City Index explicitly described. © 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."

To obtain a quantitative sense of how well China's eco-cities are doing compared to the best practices in the international arena, we have selected two cases from Japan and Germany. By examining their indicator quantities under the national eco-city framework of China, we have identified the gap between economic related indicator values, suggesting lower averaged economic values and energy efficiencies of Chinese eco-cities. Targets concerning the waste sector are also lower in China than in the other two cases. The environmental indicator values show lower quality than in the other two cases as well, and the social indicators manifest a specific methodological approach for measurements in China.

The article involves a phenomenological analysis of cases and approaches to shrinkage within the cities of Magdeburg (Germany) and Cleveland (USA). The findings point to four conceptual constraints that shape how the shrinking city is re-imagined: connotations of shrinking, actors involved, strategic focus (project or comprehensive level), and tools and techniques. Due to the structure of the system, American cities are often left with having to re-imagine themselves as growing places because they are competing regionally, nationally and internationally for project funding. German cities were found to have a similar goal but in terms of being competitive as a region and state. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Ltd."

The rationale is to make cities more resilient and productive as centres of production and consumption, and address the rising environmental and socio-cultural challenges associated with twenty-first century urban centres. There are, however, emerging or extant concepts that attempt to supplant or espouse sustainability principles or related principles; thereby, creating a seemingly unclear framework to drive effective and efficient management of cities. Through interrogation of extant literature, this study identifies four main neighbouring concepts – industrial ecology, natural capitalism, cradle-to-cradle and circular economy and how they compare and contrast with sustainability in the context of the built environment. Despite the seemingly conceptual difference between sustainability and the neighbouring concepts, they prescribe virtually the same set of principles and operationalisation indicators. However, given the multiplicity of the concepts, their set of principles and indicators, and uniqueness of different cities, an initial broad integrated framework needs to be developed based on all the concepts. Subsequently, individual cities taking cognisance of their peculiar circumstances will then have to craft their own frameworks for effective and efficient management in the face of growing economic uncertainties, poverty, rapid urbanisation and other environmental and socio-cultural challenges. © 2014 WIT Press."

This paper proposes a reformulation, in terms of urban risk management, of an earlier developed ontological scenario generation method. The procedure consists of several steps: (i) identification-and-prioritization of main pressures, (ii) paired discussion of pressures using four-cell matrices, (iii) re-visit of the pressures' priority order, (iv) articulation of short-listed pressures as decision-making questions, and (v) generation of scenarios via ""yes/no"" responses to each question, in their order of priority. In this article, the method feeds upon the general context described in recent multi-disciplinary urban studies and public strategic plans in the city of Iasi (Romania), to propose a formal procedure for enabling the acceleration of productive decision making towards city sustainability. Answering three top priority questions, namely ""Implement a business-friendly and efficient governance system?"", ""Develop a resource management system?"", and ""Carry out a human capital accelerator strategy?"" results in a 4-scenario set: Receding City, Wanting City, Promising City, Inspiring City.

Cities have undergone fundamental change in both their economies and populations. In terms of political forces, our expectation is that across a range of cities, where nonprofit environmental groups have been included or incorporated into the local policymaking process, there is greater commitment to environmental protection, and more extensive adoption and implementation of local policies and programs designed to protect the environment. To test this idea, we draw on our own research that combines two original data sets. First, we have collected information on what programs and policies are in place in America's large cities. Second, for 50 large American cities, we have also surveyed top city administrators. We find that inclusion of environmental groups in city policymaking is strongly linked to city administrators' perceptions of city commitment to environmental protection. The number of local environmental protection policies and programs also demonstrates a strong relationship to inclusion of environmental groups in city policymaking. © The Author(s) 2013."

Scenarios for the sustainable city were designed using visions and roadmaps that were actively developed by actors involved in urban development and planning. The subsequent scenario analysis on potential, coherence and distributional effects across socio-economic groups was combined with the narratives from the stakeholder dialogues to develop model-based narratives. These model-based narratives indicate the necessity of extensive national and international policy choices in the fields of energy, transport and spatial planning for the ecological sustainability of cities. The local level emerges as crucial when it comes to social sustainability. A transition that would benefit sustainability on all dimensions may be reached when citizens and civic and private organizations start to value (more) aspects of urban design and development that contribute to and create a sustainable quality of life. Thus far, little attention has been paid to policy-relevant knowledge on the urgency and complexity of triggering any such transitions. Based on the lessons learnt from this study, it can be concluded that, in the follow-up to this study, issues crucial to urban sustainable development have to be made more specific and concrete and more attention is needed for technological, institutional and societal feasibility.

The ICT infrastructure is a complex system consisting of many subsystems and interconnections, which makes the process of planning, designing, and maintaining a comprehensive ICT infrastructure expensive and difficult. Most approaches used for the ICT infrastructure modeling focus typically on a single ICT system, for example, a wireless network. This paper presents a systems modeling approach based on integrating different subsystems and their characteristics into a single model, applying system decomposition, establishing the logical relations between system components, and defining relevant key performance indicators. It is shown that this systems modeling approach facilitates holistic planning, design, and evaluation of the complex ICT infrastructure for a sustainable city. This is demonstrated in the form of a two-scenario Masdar city case study. The case study exhibits the practicality of the derived ICT model and the feasibility of the results. © 2013 IEEE."

Whenever cities engage in this innovative, ambitious and responsible task of change for integrated sustainability, an undoubtedly major amount of learning emerges; and vice versa, sound knowledge/best practices on how to proceed with local sustainability oriented change processes could be a firm support for local actors in their quest for effective and efficient action. In this paper, we present 'Urban Transition Labs' (UTL) as settings in which real life trajectories of sustainable development in cities are deployed and at the same time carefully observed; in a co-creative collaboration between actors and researchers (transdisciplinary research). Thereby, a transition management approach is applied, resulting in a cycle of five distinct phases: (a) process design and system analysis, (b) problem structuring and envisioning, (c) back casting, determining major pathways and agenda setting, (d) experimenting and (e) monitoring and evaluation. The process is guided by a 'Transition-team' that co-designs the process and feeds in relevant information to the city transition 'arenas'. These arenas are the actual initial incubators of change; they are crewed by local frontrunners that are considered as engaged visionary people with diverse backgrounds. The findings of arenas feed a further participatory process to engage the relevant city stakeholders into action. In this paper, we want to present the UTL as a potentially valuable concept to support a 'walkingthe- talk' of sustainable development by cities; and we share the first impressions on specific barriers and enablers that could determine the effectiveness of the envisaged approach. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

One of the potential solutions is the use of small-size electric vehicles (SEVs), due to their improved energy efficiency, local zero emissions, and lower traffic disturbance. In spite of all the benefits of SEV for society, advertised through experimental trials focused on social and environmental benefits, research on these vehicles’ impacts seems to overlook the effects on private stakeholders operations, namely, disregarding the replacement rate needed to assure the same delivery patterns and their purchasing and battery charging implications. Design - In this chapter, the authors contribute in filling this research gap by considering private interests, related to operation costs levels (running and driving costs), service levels, and efficiency in the promotion of SEV. Simultaneously, its balance with public interests, related with sustainability, quality of life, mobility, and environmental issues are also addressed. Findings - The authors aim to evaluate the usage of SEV in this research and to estimate the effects of replacing conventional vans by SEV on city logistics operations. The results of this quantitative analysis enlighten if SEVs are indeed a viable solution to satisfy public and private stakeholders, when operational and external costs are fully accounted. The chapter presents a case study that addresses the effects of replacing vans by SEV on city logistics operations in the city of Oporto (Portugal), considering public and private stakeholders’ interests. The study compares four scenarios of 5%, 10%, 30%, and 70% of SEVs replacing diesel vans used in transport and unloading operations. The four scenarios are tested on different geographical scales: street and city levels. First, the authors estimate how the use of SEV in city logistics affects traffic, energy consumption, and emissions. Second, the respective operating and external costs are quantified and the acquisition and battery issues are discussed. Originality/value - When considering the goal of promoting SEV as a sustainable city logistics policy, under a methodology focused on mobility, operational performance, and environmental externalities, the authors concluded (a) the replacement rate SEV:van is determinant to make a decision on whether or not to use SEVs replacing vans, (b) SEVs are economically competitive with conventional vans if the replacement rate is 1:1, (c) SEVs have a better performance at the street level rather than at the city level, (d) SEVs can be used with normal traffic as a niche of market (lower than 5%), and (e) SEVs benefits exist, but they are not significant enough to drive suppliers for their adoption. © 2014 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited All rights of reproduction in any form reserved."

Among wildlife, birds are a highly diverse, charismatic and well-known group, establishing complex communities in human settlements around the world, making them suitable bioindicators. However, it is often difficult to have historical species lists that allow understanding current urban ecology trends. In this paper, we compile the available bird records, including unpublished information, for one of the best studied and well vegetated urban areas in México: the city of Xalapa. We gathered records for 329 species, representing ~30 % of the national avifauna in this medium-sized neotropical city. This important avian diversity in the city of Xalapa is mostly due to its environmental heterogeneity, underlining the relevance of its location, and the nature of its surroundings. The information provided in this paper will not only provide an environmental education baseline and represent a starting point for ornithologists, but will represent a reference document on the birds that have been recorded within the limits of Xalapa in the last three decades. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

These endeavors are, in part, due to a persistent belief by governments that newly constructed cities can set their nations on a fast path to the future. Today, challenges posed both by global climate change and increased urbanization have widened this platform from projects almost exclusively of developing nations to include those in the developed world. Today we talk of the eco-city, a local solution to a global crisis. If completion is successfully fast-tracked, the resultant eco-city will position its respective nation at the forefront of innovation in what is effectively a global race: the resultant city can be exported as a model both locally and globally. In this regard, the envisioning and building of Songdo in South Korea may not be unique. Songdo is a city underway on flat land created from wetland reclamation. As part of the Incheon Free Economic Zone (IFEZ), Songdo's development has benefited from opportunistic circumstances that has led to its pursuit of becoming a ""Ubiquitous Eco-City."" The green infrastructure of the new city is to be enhanced by the provision of extra services that combine information and communication technologies as well as digital networks to ideally create harmony among the environment, society, and technology. Songdo, as planned, will position South Korea among a group of leading nations, and possibly at the forefront of new city development, potentially producing a model for export. © 2013 Copyright The Society of Urban Technology."

Both attempts have revolved round the premise that advanced post-modern technology, innovative urban planning, reliance on renewable energy, and emphasis on 'total' reuse can combine to achieve 'zero carbon-zero waste' existence. The plan of the two cities had also integrated strong business interests into the system, aiming to make 'zero carbon-zero waste' a kind of catch-phrase or a fashion statement that would enhance the value of the real estate the two eco-cities were planning to offer. The paper recapitulates the objectives that were set and assesses the present status of realization of those objectives. There is an already substantial and widening gap between the promise and the performance in both the cases; the review identifies the gaps and the possible reasons of their occurrence. It is highlighted that the expectation of a zero-waste existence is inherently flawed because the Second Law of Thermodynamics makes it impossible to attain. The paper brings out that no 'eco-city' concept can be translated into reality unless and until the inhabitants of the eco-city are prepared to voluntarily and consistently observe certain restrictions on resource consumption and to sacrifice some of the basically illusory but highly fancied 'comforts' which drive consumption in conventional habitations. It follows that many of those measures that are sought to be introduced in the eco-cities to make them cleaner and greener can very much be implemented in existing cities if only the same extent of voluntary participation from the lay public can be invoked that is expected in the 'eco-cities'. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd."

What distinguishes the eco-city from work on sustainable urbanism more broadly, the article argues, is its attempt to create a comprehensive and transferable model of sustainable urban development. Over the years, the eco-city, in both theory and application, has evolved along with broader trends in environmental thought. The idea of the eco-city originally emerged out of counterculture movements of the 1960s and 1970s as an approach to urban development that would respect environmental limits. Contemporary eco-city projects attempt to transcend these limits and are often driven as much by economic objectives as environmental ones. Although many eco-city projects market themselves as models for future urban development, the article argues that they are better seen as sites of experimentation and innovation, helping drive broader socio-technical transitions. The article concludes that the ability of eco-cities to achieve their utopian ambitions may be limited by the realities of operating within a profit-driven, entrepreneurial planning environment. However, they can still play a valuable role, providing a place to test new ideas and an ideal to aspire to. © 2014 University College London."

Today's mega cities, which compose by continuously receiving migration from rural areas, cause destructions -that is hard to be recovered- by significantly ruining the nature and natural sources with their unplanned configuration and causes. This condition leads to the destruction of environment and the environment looses its ability renewal. Today human, that has realized the consumption of natural sources by it, has started to carry out operations for establishing eco-cities which preserve the permanence of natural sources.

The analysis of the urban policies led in suburbs of New York and Paris show a green city ideal, capable of changing the image of poor urban territory. Thus, natural spaces appear to develop in substitution of peripheral urban spaces considered unable to create placemaking and public space. This condemnation of peripheral urban spaces by landscape designers and cityplanners stands then in contradiction with the perceptions and spatial investment of the residents. Moreover, this ""landscape urbanism"" seems to express an ideal of ""green city"", through the development of collective /public natural spaces, with the capacity of bringing by itself urbanity, in a sense of citizenship (political life), citadinity (urban life) and civility (social life). The Social practices are more and more individual and the spatial investment more and more diverse. Meanwhile, the citizens' perception and the meanings attributed to the urban environment become more heterogeneous. Then, how do reconsider the composition of the landscapes language capable of transforming the people's relation to their environment? How do reconcile the designed spaces with perceived, lived and imagined spaces by inhabitants? How do built landscapes and green spaces able to think an other urban life and urbanity of public spaces?."

These images of sustainable green cities pose a challenge to defining ecological civic space and green architecture, especially in the transformation of Jakarta into an eco-architectural hub that balances social, economic, and environmental issues.

Its key features - based on the analysis of a census of 178 initiatives - include: the significant, global proliferation of eco-city initiatives; increased international knowledge transfer activities involving both public and private actors; the centrality of 'carbon discourse' guiding concepts, policy and practice; the marrying of 'green' with 'smart' technological systems; and a focus on achieving environmental innovation through economic growth. Among the implications is the need to moderate the 'ubiquitous eco-city' paradigm with strong local contextualisation and social sustainability measures. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."

The urban buffers may be defined as seams between areas of diverse urban functions, particularly those of contradicting functions. The dynamic development processes often occurring in peripheral zones of cities are subject to multiple social, political and economic pressure factors and diminish the rationality of planning and spatial management. On one hand, there is a classic process of urban sprawl, well described in the literature and resulting mostly in housing pouring out of timely limits of urban structures. On the other hand, there are larger infrastructural or industrial developments with their primary assumption on being settled in well communicated but cheap land plots. This kind of mixture results in creating interweaved fabric of many functions and their areas of influence overlapping and producing conflicting zones. This paper will attempt to diagnose and systematize buffer areas as well as confront ways the conflicts manifest with possible planning and design solutions aimed at weakening negative effects or eliminating those effects. © 2014 WIT Press."

Cities and urban areas face many challenges - economic, social, health and environmental - which are often exacerbated by an increase in the frequency of natural disasters. Together, these challenges call for a shift towards sustainable cities which reduce their impact on the surrounding environment, whilst at the same time succeeding to make resources available to their increasing number of inhabitants. This study explores the state of the art of water management practices of the highly urbanised Northern Italian region and plans and scope for the future development of water management. Although the region is at present not under severe water stress, recently some cities faced water scarcity problems and were forced to implement water rationing. We assessed the vulnerability of Parma and Ferrara to a water crisis, together with the regular and emergency adaptation measures already in place, and the forecast for the near future. In two workshops, the authors adapted the Australian concept of water sensitive urban design for the Italian context. Although the population remains generally unaware of the impact of the two latest severe drought events (2003 and 2006/7), many adaptation measures towards a more sustainable use of the water resource are already in place - technically, institutionally, and individually. Water managers consider however that the drastic and definite changes needed to integrate the urban water management cycle, and which minimise the ecological footprint of urban spaces, lay far in the future. © 2014 IEEE."

This urban center of approximately one million people is the largest in the Kyrgyz Republic, and one of the larger cities in Central Asia. Dubbed ""the Tree City"" during the Soviet Era, it, like other Central Asian population centers, occupies an oasis-like environment at the foot of a major mountain range, the Ala-Too Range of the Tian Shan (Mts.). This major mountain massif, which extends across the northern part of Central Asia and on into North-West China, has numerous peaks more than 4,000 m high and many glaciers. It is these snowfields that provide most of the water used by the city of Bishkek and its suburbs.; Methodology - The findings represented herein are based on ethnographic field observations and interviews conducted in 2006-2007 and 2013-2014. A variety of documentary resources were accessed as well.; Research findings - During Soviet times, Bishkek and its environs were the location of industrial complexes focused on the processing of minerals and agricultural produce, much of which was shipped to other republics within the USSR. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, many of these industrial sites have fallen into disuse and disrepair. So, while Bishkek has numerous ""socialist"" planned parks, long-established green spaces, and a relatively large ""urban forest"" along major boulevards and thoroughfares, it is also dotted with abandoned factories, warehouses, and crumbling infrastructure. In parts of the city, and especially around its perimeter, urban fruit and vegetable gardens have reappeared, as many residents had to return to subsistence gardening to provide basic food needs for their households. In the last decade, however, the local economy has begun to diversify and grow. This has brought more cars to the streets and a substantial number of new businesses and building projects, along with increasing amounts of air, water, and noise pollution. Concomitant with this new development has been the emergence of a nascent green movement, the establishment of environmental organizations, and a small but growing ""green consciousness"" as witnessed by the creation of new recycling programs, increased bicycle travel, and related activities pointing toward a more sustainable future.; Implications - In this chapter, the relative sustainability (social, cultural, economic, and ecological) of this Central Asian urban center are considered as it has emerged from its Soviet past to become the focal point of new enterprises, including a small but growing ecotourism industry. Bishkek, in common with other major cities of this region, which is far from the moderating influences of the sea, must adapt to the realities of what are likely to be increasingly severe climate change impacts - increased average annual temperatures, the rapid retreat of mountain glaciers and a reduction in the essential waters that they provide, and increasingly severe and numerous periods of drought. Whether or not Bishkek can successfully adapt to these changes and emerge as a more sustainable city remains to be seen. © 2014 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

However, planning as a formal responsibility of the government has been developed only since the enactment of the Town and Country Planning (TCP) Act in 1954. Therefore, urban planning can be considered to be quite recent in Mauritius. Moreover, the concept of 'sustainability' in planning is in the infancy stage in the country. In 2008, the Prime Minister announced his new, long-term vision of transforming the country into a sustainable island - ""Maurice Ile Durable"" (MID), the key objective of which is to make Mauritius a world model for sustainable development, particularly in the context of the Small Island Developing States. The government is also coming up with a new concept of 'Eco-Village' to make new villages which are more sustainable. But in order to do so, it is very important to find the level of sustainability of the existing towns and villages in Mauritius and to make a critical assessment of the land use planning framework in the island. Urbanisation is an important component when considering sustainable development and vice versa. Unfortunately, rapid urban development has contributed to the degradation of our ecosystem. Mauritius is a small island state where there is a limited amount of natural resources and one of the main objectives of the government is to promote Mauritius as a 'Sustainable Island State'. This paper makes a critical assessment of existing planning framework in Mauritius after evaluating other countries frameworks in order to promote effective sustainable cities in Mauritius. © 2013 WIT Press."

Introducing low emission vehicles is one of the major measures foreseen in alleviating negative externalities. In this context, city logistics may represent a market niche for the deployment of electric vehicles. This paper introduces a methodology based on the Systems of Innovation approach to examine the process by which electric vehicles may be introduced in city logistics. The proposed methodology considers the complex interactions between actors and institutions and proposes a Systems' of Innovation Framework, which combines in a matrix the actors, the mechanisms and market conditions providing an instrument by which to qualitatively assess the current status and estimate future requirements and pre-conditions for innovation uptake. Applied to the case of electric vehicles in city logistics, the proposed framework is used to examine ""who"" should act, ""how to act"", ""what to act upon"" and ""when"" to intervene. Findings indicate the need to transfer leadership from central authorities to municipal authorities in order to move from the initiation stage to the implementation stage. The importance of strong networks between innovation actors and respective building of capacities is considered of importance. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd."

The aim has been to prove that ultra modern technology, innovative urban planning, reliance on renewable energy, and emphasis on 'total' reuse can combine to achieve existence of 'zero-carbon zero-waste comfort'. The founding fathers of the two cities had also factored strong business interests into the system, aiming to make 'zero-carbon zero-waste' tag a unique selling proposition of the real estate that was on offer in those eco-cities. The paper recounts the objectives that were set assesses the present status of realization of those objectives. There is an already substantial and widening gap between the promise and the performance in both the cases; the paper identifies the gaps and the possible reasons of their occurrence. It is highlighted that the expectation of a zero-waste existence is inherently flawed because the Second Law of Thermodynamics makes it impossible to attain. It is brought out that no 'eco-city' concept can be translated into reality unless and until the inhabitants of the eco-city are prepared to voluntarily and consistently observe certain restrictions on resource consumption and to sacrifice some of the basically illusory but highly fancied and fashionable 'comforts' which drive consumption in the name of growth in conventional habitations. It follows that many of those measures that are sought to be introduced in the eco-cities to make them cleaner and greener can very much be implemented in existing cities. Even more significantly, the presently occurring runaway growth of most cities can be made less burdensome on the environment by exercising a few controls if only the same extent of voluntary participation from the lay public can be invoked that is expected in the 'eco-cities'. © Sila Science.

Urban sustainability has become the key concept around which such activities are organized. Official sustainability plans are most often implemented through indicators and metrics. In Minneapolis, Minnesota, urban gardening, in a variety of forms, has been the focus of ongoing citizen- and NGO-led environmental efforts, as well as municipal measures of sustainability. Here, debates around the recent adoption of a city urban agriculture policy, as well as a program to encourage the installation of raingardens in neighborhoods across the city, reveal some of the rich variations in gardening practices and spaces. These far exceed the relatively narrow official focus on sustainability indicators.

Both cities have been well known for their attempts to bring about transitions towards more sustainable and low-carbon energy systems. The comparison of Graz and Freiburg over a period of two decades enables us to study how differing contexts, actor constellations and historic developments shape the transformation of energy systems towards greater sustainability. It is argued that understanding the role of cities for energy transitions requires a detailed examination of the coupled dynamics of socio-technical interactions across the levels of niches, regimes and landscapes on the one hand, and multilevel systems of governance on the other. At these intersections new, although spatially confined, socio-technical constellations of sustainable energy provision may emerge and be stabilised. Nevertheless, empirical evidence shows that it is misleading to conclude that true socio-technical transitions are taking place in these cities, even though a number of foundations for long-term change processes have been laid. © 2013 Urban Studies Journal Limited."

This paper examines the application of the central methodology of the Sustainable Cities Programme in Nigeria and explores how it can contribute in the shift towards alternative urban planning approaches. Data were collected using combined methods of questionnaire survey, individual interviews and document review. Progress was made in adopting broad based inclusiveness in negotiating and prioritizing issues of concern; preparing the cities' Profiles for a wider understanding of the interrelationship of development activities and the environment in addressing urban challenges; building consensus and in coordination among sectors. Cities' level of institutionalization of the common components of the process was low. Political and professional commitment, public support, education and information and a strong core of change agents are some ofthe contributing factors in shifting towards innovative approaches expected to respond to urban challenges. The results are directly useful in developing measures for making a major shift in policies, planning practice and education in Nigeria. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd."

This chapter takes stock of an emerging strand of the sustainable city literature that recognizes local political dynamics, conflicts of interest, and power struggles.; Approach - The review is organized into three sections. The first section reviews how past studies have utilized sustainable urban development as an opportunity for advancing theories of urban politics, highlighting recent developments in the growth machine, regulatory state, and risk society theses. The second section examines a range of studies that place the questions of scale, unit, and boundary at the center of inquiry. The third section draws together a body of research that interrogates different meanings of sustainability.; Implications - The first section discusses the extent to which social and political processes in the sustainability age exhibit a pattern consistent with established theoretical accounts. The second section focuses on studies that address how urban sustainable development has brought challenges to existing configurations of spatial relations. These studies pose important methodological and epistemological questions for studying environmental politics. In the third section, the focus is placed on political implications of urban sustainable development, which is subject to multiple interpretations.; Originality - This chapter ends with a review of an emerging thesis - strategic urbanism, which draws attention to the patterns of change in urban politics. Much of the contributions to this thesis are based on urban sustainability politics in recent years. © 2014 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

The comparison of these different themes, from the most abstract to the extremely practical or concrete and even experimental concepts create problems a priori for some unknown reason and react poorly to analysis. The scope will be defined before attempting to apply it to the city. Then, a diachronic approach to sustainable development (SD) in relation to the city will shed light on the contradictions, but also on any aporias. Finally, part three shall conclude that the city or the urban area, as a space and building producer, will have to accept the consequences of these contradictions while generating solutions opposite to those that should be respected to meet SD criteria and in keeping the three paradoxes in perspective. In direct reference to SD, we shall try to show the consequences of the application of these various principles to a city reclassified as a “sustainable” city. © 2014, Franco Angeli Edizioni.

The crux of this is to create the smallest possible ecological footprint, and to produce the lowest quantity of pollution possible, to use land efficiently; compost used materials, recycle it or convert waste-to-energy. An eco-city is a city designed with consideration of environmental impact, inhabited by people dedicated to minimisation of required inputs of energy, water and food, and waste output of heat, air pollution and water pollution. The various aspects of this principle include education and training for all in sustainable urban development, technical training and up-skilling, research, exchange of experiences, knowledge dissemination through research publications about sustainable design city theory. © 2013 WIETE."

At the time of writing, more than 200 eco-city projects have been proposed, are under construction, or have even been partly or fully implemented. Many of these eco-cities are not retro-fitted development plans in the downtown areas but are new large-scale land development projects on the outskirts of municipalities. The impetus behind the current Chinese 'new-town-style' eco-cities can be viewed as the third round of post-Mao land development isomorphism. The first - development zones - took place in the 1980s, and the second - college towns - started from the late 1990s. In the post-Mao context, Chinese local entrepreneurialism, which is characterized by (1) inter-scalar strategies to formally and informally pursue projects and (2) novel discourses that seek to legitimize projects, is actually motivated by land finance. Therefore, Chinese eco-cities driven by land-speculation-oriented local entrepreneurialism are very likely to be yet another manifestation of spatial development fervour, which contributes to further local extra-budgetary revenue and generates social conflict as opposed to sustainable development. © The Author(s) 2013."

Understanding this gap, the reason for its emergence, and its implications is the core of this article. It first reviews the demanding requirements for eco-city development as formulated in the literature. Then the political and administrative realities in China are discussed to illustrate how Chinese policy-makers incorporate the idea in their policy-making practice. Next, lessons learned from an eco-city project in Shenzhen are presented to compare the theoretical insights with realities on the ground the authors have observed. The authors conclude that an intercultural dialogue on international eco-city frameworks and standards is necessary, and that new, greener standards should be anchored to the institutional system in China for the performance assessment of political leaders responsible for the future of urban development in China. © 2013 Copyright The Society of Urban Technology."

Firstly it explores the emergence of creative city's discourses and practices and their significance, then the conditions of sustainability of the urban development, and finally the arts' role in achieving urban creativity and sustainable development. While acknowledging the importance of the environmental-ecological aspect, the focus of this article is on the social and cultural aspects of sustainability in the development of creative cities. The main argument is that different approaches to the issues of creativity and sustainability as well as different strategies for developing the sustainable creative city depend not only on various levels of urban space and agents considered but also on values they share. While claims to scientific objectivity are common, most approaches towards these issues are not merely descriptive but necessarily normative. Therefore, the ideological assumptions and implications of these topics are relevant. The debate is exemplified by Scott's polemical meditation versus Florida on the nature and significance of the creative city, highlighting not only its positive but also its ""darker"", i.e., non-sustainable dimensions. The article concludes by showing that the creative city concept does not only re-produce the dominant market order (as it is the dominant objective today) but could instead relate to communal identity, social belongingness, and a deeper sense of place as formulated by the broader demands of sustainability. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd."

This approach draws inspiration from recent attempts to bring actor-network theory (ANT) closer to urban studies, infusing urban political economies with STS sensibility towards the contingencies of eco-socio-technical design and transformation processes. ANT, I argue, offers a new ontology for the city, allowing the study of those concrete and plural sites at which urban sustainability is known, practiced, scaled, negotiated and contested, in heterogeneous and dynamic assemblages of humans and non-humans. I explore the analytical potentials of this ANT urban ontology through a case study of how architects, engineers, and urban planners currently perform Nordhavn, one of Europe's large-scale sustainable city building projects, as a site of multiple matters of public-political concern with urban natures."

Most likely, a different method can be found, starting from the assumption that the city could be considered as a complex system. In a way, we can say that the Smart City is a physical space in which technology is widespread, available and inclusive and supports a new growth of social capital, the renewal of the material urban dimension and allows the development of new functional systems throughout the “virtualization” of some urban activities. The process towards the knowledge of “urban smartness” is conditioned to a first step, which is a common phase in the two new dimensions of modern urban planning: sustainable planning and smart planning. Both of these two dimensions try to manage the evolution of the urban system and drive it towards a future state that should be compatible with the available resources as well as sustainable considering the future needs of human beings as well as the planet. In order to initiate the management of territorial transformation, there is one first obligatory step in common with all new urban planning: the reduction of urban entropy. Urban entropy represents the main obstacle to starting new sustainable processes of urban planning and corresponds to all the kinds of urban dyscrasia that can occur within the urban subsystems. In order to reduce urban entropy, we first need to develop a way to identify and to measure it inside the different city sub-systems. This paper proposes a useful method which can be used to measure it and to envisage urban actions aimed at reducing negativity of the city by using new technologies. © 2014 WIT Press."

However, as there is a noticeable lack of critical analysis of what constitutes Solarsiedlung as an ""eco-city"", this paper studies narratives and practices of sustainable urban development. First, we look at Solarsiedlung as a best-practice model - a narrative that was produced and perpetuated by architects, urban planners, investors and academics celebrating this neighbourhood as a technologically leapfrogging, economically sound and socially integrated project. Second, we explore the everyday practices and lived experience of the residents in Solarsiedlung. Bringing together these two perspectives, we contribute to a more comprehensive understanding and critical reading of the interplay between the ecological, economic and social dimensions of sustainable development as seen from different viewpoints. Findings indicate that Solarsiedlung as a best-practice model is embedded in growth-oriented neoliberal strategies that are in conflict with the everyday practices and lived experience of the residents.

This model has been developed by combining a depth integrated hydrodynamic and water quality model with a habitat suitability index model. Carps were selected as the target species because they represent the major fish population in the study area. Water depth, flow velocity and dissolved oxygen (DO) were used as the suitability indicators. Hydrologic data recorded during 2001-2010 were analysed to determine the base flow, average flow and high flow rates, which were used to represent the discharges in the river for the three stages of the carp life cycle: overwintering, spawning and growth, respectively. Numerical model simulations were undertaken to determine the levels of habitat suitability for carps to live at these three life stages. The model results indicate that under the current flow regime the habitat suitability level in the lacustrine region is too low for carps at the growth and overwintering stages. DO depletion, overriding the role of velocity and depth, is attributed to the poorly suited habitat conditions in the lacustrine region. To improve the suitability conditions in the lacustrine region, a DO enhancement scheme was used. Model results show that the scheme has significantly enhanced the water quality, with the ideally suited area increased from 24.4% to 67.9% for the overwintering stage and from 44.5% to 77.5% for the growth stage. Due to the high flow requirement for carps to spawn in the fluvial region, further numerical model simulations were undertaken to investigate the effect of flow augmentation on the carp spawning habitat suitability. Non-traditional water obtained from recycled domestic and industrial wastewater in the Eco-City was used as an additional water resource. The analysis indicates that the Eco-City has sufficient non-traditional water to meet the high flow requirement for carps to spawn in the fluvial region. © 2013 Elsevier B.V."

In this research we adapt the extended metabolism model of a city developed by Newman (Sustainability and cities: extending the metabolism model 1999) and the material and energy flow accounting by Sheeri (UK material flow accounting 2002) to assess the future role of electric vehicles, renewable energy use for mobility needs and energy efficiency increases for households living in the city of Aveiro, a medium-sized city of 78,450 inhabitants in Portugal. The data used comprised an integrated set of energy, transport, socio-economic and solid waste production/treatment collected at the local and National level as part of the research project COST-TRENDS funded by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology. The analysis of the potential energy mix (energy inputs from different sources) and households' mobility needs refers to the horizon 2010-2020.

Potential accessibility indicators were developed to better converge towards sustainable mobility objectives, measuring the potential for interaction and exchange of services and opportunities. Different household's profiles were established to represent consumers' behaviour.

This can weaken the urban economic base, reduce the supply of good-job producing land, and contribute to industrial-sector suburban sprawl. Purpose: We expose smart growth's blind side by revealing the lack of attention to urban industrial redevelopment in planning practice. We expand the smart growth dialogue by describing a) the impacts on productive urban industrial land of adopting smart policies, and b) local government measures to protect urban industry while pursuing smart growth. Methods: We review the recent local industrial policies of 14 cities and 10 practice-oriented smart growth publications with local economic development components to reveal the disconnect between urban industrial development and smart growth approaches. We compare elements of adopted local industrial policies from selected cities with commonly accepted smart growth principles to illuminate the challenges smart growth policies pose for protecting and revitalizing urban industrial areas. Results and conclusions: Our review of cities initiating local industrial policies reveals that significant amounts of industrial land have been converted to other uses as cities pursued smart growth. The smart growth literature provides little to no acknowledgment of the need to coordinate urban industrial development practices with other mainstay smart growth activities. Although development pressures to convert industrial land to higher densities and other uses persist, the national economic crisis has led to a call for strengthening manufacturing. There has also been a decline in the nonindustrial infill development that epitomizes smart growth projects. Together these trends present opportunities and challenges for city and regional planners to change smart growth approaches. Takeaway for practice: Industrial land is at risk in cities. Recent efforts to reduce this risk, such as explicit local policies to preserve industrial land and jobs while also pursuing smart growth, illustrate how challenging it is to attract new manufacturers and prevent further industrial decline in urban neighborhoods. Pursuing smart growth and sustainable urban industrial development should not be an either/or proposition, and requires approaches that explicitly safeguard productive urban industrial land and discourage industrial sprawl. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."

Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, the term 'eco-city' remained mainly a concept, a collection of ideas and propositions about sustainable urban planning, transportation, housing, public participation and social justice, with practical examples relatively few and far between. Since the mid 2000s, the phenomenon appears to have become increasingly global and mainstream, against the background of the international recognition of the scale and severity of climate change and rapid urbanisation, particularly in the developing world. To date, there have been few systematic surveys of eco-cities. This paper presents the findings of a global survey carried out in 2009. The study maps, analyses and compares some 79 identified eco-city initiatives, and addresses questions, such as what are key features that distinguish eco-cities from 'normal' cities; how to define them; why they have become international and mainstream in a short period of time; and what kind of issues their implementation in different contexts raise.

The study thus demonstrated the positive relationship of the city with diversified vegetation cover for cleaner environment. The analysis is expected to guide formulation of strategies for maintaining green space in the city. © 2012 Elsevier GmbH."

This trend is accelerated by the increased demand and desire for safer, more reliable and more comfortable buildings under uncertain external loading and environment. Viscous, visco-elastic, hysteretic and friction dampers are representatives of passive dampers. Such passive dampers also play a key role in the implementation of structural rehabilitation which is essential for the realization and promotion of sustainable buildings. The technique of structural health monitoring is inevitable for the reliable and effective installation of passive dampers during the structural rehabilitation or retrofit. The design earthquake ground motions change from time to time when a new class of ground motions (e.g. long-period ground motions due to surface waves) is observed or a new type of damage appears during severe earthquakes. The concept of critical excitation is useful in responding to this change together with the usage of passive dampers from the viewpoint of sustainable buildings and cities. In this paper, a historical review is made on the development of smart or optimal building structural control with passive dampers and some possibilities of structural rehabilitation by use of passive dampers are discussed. © 2010 Elsevier B.V."

Sustainable policy design could also be affected by several factors that cause the deflection of resources initially allocated to other groups that are contrary to the concerns pursued and have the power to veto sustainable plans by exerting pressure on the party in power. In this sense, the aim of this paper is to show the impact that political factors have on cities' sustainability, and the effect of both on cities' economic development. To do so, we used the 78 Spanish cities with a population over 100,000 studied by MERCO (Spanish Corporate Reputation Monitor) as regards their levels of sustainability for the fiscal years 2008 and 2009. Both relationships have been tested empirically through two dependence models using linear regression techniques. The results obtained show that political competition improves cities' sustainability, while a leftist ideology has an inverse impact.

Doxiadis and Doxiadis Associates in the late 1950s, is now a fast-growing city of about 1.5 million inhabitants, forming, together with the adjacent old city of Rawalpindi and a National Park, a Metropolitan Area (Greater Islamabad/Rawalpindi Area) of about 4.5 million inhabitants. This paper presents the combined land use-transportation planning of Islamabad, within the broader framework of the C.A. Doxiadis Ekistics theory. An evaluation of the results follows, based on a visit by the author and on more recent information. The advantages of the clear hierarchy of residential communities, of the related functions and of the transport system are apparent in the segregation of the various categories of movements (i.e. high/low speed Road Traffic, Public Transport, Bicycles, Pedestrians, etc.) and in the reduction of trip lengths. They will be more and more apparent as the urban area expands and the population and car ownership increase. With proper management of traffic and demand, the road network will not be subject to the capacity and related serious environmental problems observed in almost all large cities of the world. The present quality of life in Islamabad is made apparent from the satisfaction expressed by the people who live and work there and by the wish of others to reside in the new city.

The paper describes a special kind of scenario methodology to build a future model for city development as a planning tool in facilitating a sustainable society. Backcasting in futures studies is widely discussed together with the comparison of three selected backcasting approaches, including Robinson's approach, The Natural Step Framework, and the Sustainable Technology Development approach. The purposes of this paper are to examine and discuss the use of the backcasting method within the Project Göteborg 2050, lessons learned and findings drawn from the experience. The case study shows that backcasting is an appropriate method in developing action plans for achieving urban sustainability.

The project aims to promote the urban rehabilitation and the returning of citizens to this forgotten area, by integrating the ecological structure and the old industrial buildings together as landmarks for landscape urbanism. Objectives of this urban rehabilitation project as promoting the integration and enhancement of the building structure / ecological component: - To propose measures of urban design for old industrial buildings and for ecological component of the stream in order to promote a balance between these two components of the city; - To create a leisure area with a riverside walk in order to promote the integration and enhancement of the stream in the local context and throughout the city; - To create an ecological corridor to ensure the environmental balance of this area by integrating the ecological structure into the urban system; - To allow the rehabilitation of old industrial buildings and, above all, the buildings heritage that goes back to an industrial past, present in the collective imagination of the citizens, in order to promote new activities in the derelict industrial buildings and new housing places; In summary, this landscape urbanism proposal aims to qualify and improve the image of the city.

Radical changes in city planning are being made to switch to sustainable development, with new cities being designed to be ecologically friendly guided by principles like carbon neutrality and self-sufficiency. This paper introduces the development of the Dongtan eco-city project on Chongming Island, Shanghai and describes how it addresses issues including energy, water, waste, transportation, ecosystem, and social and economic development in its design. The lessons and challenges of eco-city development based on the Dongtan experience are also discussed. If the vision of a zero-carbon emissions sustainable city is successfully realized, Dongtan will serve as a model for developing similar cities across China and the rest of the developing world. Currently, the development of this project is behind schedule and whether the eco-city plan will materialize or not is in question.

Since Japan's rapid industrialization in the late nineteenth century, there has been an emphasis on economic growth at all costs. Despite the introduction of the concept of the Garden City in Japan in the early twentieth century, industrialization continued unabated. After a disastrous World War II, the nation rebuilt and enjoyed rapid economic growth in the 1950s and 1960s. Japan is still coming to terms with the cost of that economic growth. The paper examines three cities: Minamata, Kitakyūshū, and Kawasaki. Minamata has transformed itself from being a polluted city to a green tourism destination. The city of Kitakyūshū embraced an eco-town strategy in 1997 to promote a structural shift away from heavy industries to green industries. That year, Kawasaki (close to the Tokyo Metropolitan area), too, was designated an eco-town and Minamata received the same title in 2001. This paper identifies key features of eco-cities/eco-towns in Japan, the importance of retrofitting, and examines the roles of citizens, the government, and the private sector. What is surprising is the international orientation of Japanese eco-cities. These cities represent not only Japan's future, but also its efforts to deal with its industrial past. © 2013 Copyright The Society of Urban Technology."

It is important for urban designers and planners to explore an eco-designing method for Chongqing's development in order to cope with a conflict between urbanization and energy crisis as well as to solve ecological environmental problems with the City sprawling. This paper illustrates a conceptual planning design of Chongqing Yuelai Eco-city made by HITSGSS, in which the importance of water to the Eco-city has been concerned. An idea of using the water resources to fertilize the Eco-city in the mountain area has been proposed via examining the geographical and morphological characteristics of the planned area. With respect to the nature mountain and the river, the design is focused on ecological conservation and low carbon development through integrating water element into the planning scheme. In addition, the possibility of using the city waste to generate clean electricity has also been explored. In a word, this paper presents a design scheme of Yuelai Eco-city in Chongqing, which explores ecological approaches for low carbon emission and energy savings in building environmental friendly and social wellbeing societies."

Emerging from these efforts have been high-profile, highly symbolic projects: the green roof atop Chicago's city hall, New York City's MillionTreesNYC program, and San Francisco's network of parks reclaimed from parking spaces (called 'parklets'). This paper argues that such projects represent a new ""mobilization of the spectacle"" - a reflection of a popular desire to reimagine the city, but produced on the terms of (and even on behalf of) market forces and neoliberal reason.

As post-industrial cities redefine themselves, they must consider the consolidation of resources and scale in response to constantly changing economic and demographic variables. This means that, paradoxically, cities may need to physically shrink to create density before they can grow economically.

Examples of city logistics initiatives are urban distribution centers, congestion pricing, delivery timing and access restrictions. In this paper, we present a hybrid approach based on Affinity Diagram, AHP and fuzzy TOPSIS for evaluating city logistics initiatives. Four initiatives namely vehicle sizing restrictions, congestion charging schemes, urban distribution center and access timing restrictions are considered. The proposed approach consists of four steps. The first step involves identification of criteria for assessing performance of city logistics initiatives using Affinity Diagram. The results are four categories of criteria namely technical, social, economical and environmental. In step 2, a decision making committee comprising of representatives of city logistics stakeholders is formed. These stakeholders are shippers, receivers, transport operators, end consumers and public administrators. The committee members weight the selected criteria using AHP. In step 3, the decision makers provide linguistic ratings to the alternatives (city logistics initiatives) to assess their performance against the selected criteria. These linguistic ratings are then aggregated using fuzzy TOPSIS to generate an overall performance score for each alternative. The alternative with the highest score is finally chosen as most suitable city logistics initiative for improving city sustainability. In the fourth step, we perform sensitivity analysis to evaluate the influence of criteria weights on the selection of the best alternative. The proposed approach is novel and can be practically applied for selecting sustainable city logistics initiatives for cities. Another advantage is its ability to generate solutions under limited quantitative information. An empirical application of the proposed approach is provided. © 2011 Elsevier Inc."

Design/methodology/approach: The study selects eight local sustainability programs in Portugal using two different program designs and compares several indicators of performance in terms of program implementation, outputs, and outcomes. Findings: Cities using the top-down approach to programmatic intervention are more successful in accomplishing sustainability goals than cities engaging in the bottom-up approach. The second program design produced more visible physical outputs, whereas the first effectively achieved sustainability goals. Practical implications: The main policy implication of the study is that program design and structure are decisive to achieve sustainability goals. In the case of Programmatic contracts run by general-purpose local governments, the incentive structure facilitates the appropriation of goals for electoral purposes by local officials. The Programmatic contracts are administered by local government officials who are primarily concerned with economic revitalization and delivering tangible infrastructure. The sustainability label should be removed from these initiatives. Originality/value: The paper shows that the incentive structure created by program design features influences the achievement of sustainability goals by local communities. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

Among these, two have been in the making since the early 2000s in California, USA, from where the eco-city movement originated over 20 years ago: Treasure Island, in San Francisco, and Sonoma Mountain Village, in Rohnert Park (Sonoma County). This article analyses these urban sustainability initiatives in terms of the emerging hybrid governance relations and interactions and how these inform the planning, co-ordination and implementation of the initiatives.

Now that many urban areas have set themselves on a trajectory to becoming sustainable cities, it is timely to point out some potential pitfalls that may be encountered along this transition. This review considers pitfalls that range from the practicalities of analyzing sustainability in cities through to more philosophical issues such as our understanding of urban sustainability. If the type of mitigative actions proposed in this artile to avoid these pitfalls are not taken, then well-meaning sustainability initiatives may result in undesirable side effects.

I argue that these challenges are quite fundamental and centre around our ‘vision’ of the sustainable city and the processes required to bring about sustainable urban development. I draw on my own experience and the work of others to suggest that within the sustainable cities discourse there are a number of competing ‘visions’ of sustainable urbanism, and that it is important that we understand and value this multiplicity of socially-constructed potential futures, rather than adopt a ‘one model fits all’ appraoch. In terms of sustainable urban development processes, I suggest that research, practise and expertise tend to coalesce around either scientific and technological advances or around social change (largely couched in terms of behaviour, economic or governance shifts). Yet we need to move past this dualistic thinking towards a far deeper understanding of the interplay between social and technical solutions if we are make real progress. I hope this new journal provides a forum to explore different ‘visions’ and to share knowledge on the ‘mulitple-pathways’ that sustainable urban development may take. © 2009, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

By drawing on recent research conducted in Melbourne, Australia, this article demonstrates the importance of incorporating urban climate understanding and knowledge into urban planning processes to better develop cities that are more sustainable. Melbourne currently experiences the effects of a modified urban climate, with research demonstrating that during the night, urban areas are often warmer than surrounding rural landscapes: an effect known as the 'urban heat island'. Recent studies also suggest that continuing current patterns of development without intervention would produce degraded urban climates with further exacerbated urban temperatures. With the urgency regarding the enhanced greenhouse effect, the urban heat island is an extremely important issue, as the growing urban population could be further exposed to elevated temperatures. Given our improved understanding of the interactions between the built environment and urban climates, those involved in urban planning and development should begin to adopt this knowledge. Many opportunities exist to intentionally modify the built environment (e.g. cool roofs; water-sensitive urban design) to minimise the risks of developing unfavourable urban climates. © 2010 Editorial Board, Urban Policy and Research."

Different perspectives on sustainable housing encompass technical, social, political and economic issues. Physical indicators are not enough to assess the overall quality of housing. Perceptions of sustainable housing have moved from individual dwellings to issues of community and neighbourhood. Romania is confronted with specific challenges in housing. Due to the wholesale privatisation of the early 1990s, Romania is a ""country of homeowners"" with over 97% of the housing stock in private ownership. Twenty years after the political changes, the country is still confronted with a wide range of housing sustainability issues: at the level of buildings with overdue maintenance and repair, energy use, raising running costs; at neighbourhood level with transportation, public space, dissatisfaction of residents; at city level, with the growing negative perception of certain neighbourhoods and the declining asset value of properties. In Bucharest, where over 80% of dwellings are situated in blocks of flats in large housing estates built after 1960, housing is largely at odds with the barriers that would make the housing environment liveable: economic, financial, institutional, perceptual, behavioural and, not least, the market. Government actions and certain community initiatives address the security of buildings, security of tenure, security of asset value. New construction is constrained by scarce free land within the city and a market that caters mainly for the upper income scale. Freedom of choice has been restricted so far to residential parks at the outskirts of the city and some condominiums scattered within its boundaries.

This paper explores the issues related to the development of accessibility measures for non-motorised modes, namely bicycling and walking.

This current model of power generation and supply and ever growing demand is unsustainable and will need to adapt. The design and management of energy infrastructure for new and existing cities must change in order to make better use of resources through a combination of energy efficiency, application of new and emerging technologies and a shift to renewable sources of energy. The future of city energy infrastructure lies in an holistic approach to supply, demand and distribution. Security of supply and intermittency considerations need energy systems that can respond to changes in energy source availability and to changes in demand whilst ensuring resources are not wasted. Buildings and cities must be designed to work sympathetically with renewable energy supply systems requiring buildings that are not only designed to minimise energy use but be capable of responding to the condition of the supply network through short term dynamic control and storage.

Regular pedestrians and cyclists can expect to enjoy potential health benefits, while modal shift to active travel can lead to considerable environmental improvements at a broad range of spatial scales. However, given the need to ensure high-quality decision-making in the transport sector, it is paramount that contemporary evaluation practices keep pace with the shifting nature of policies that explicitly encourage uptake of walking and cycling. Drawing on a numerical example, this paper examines the extent to which the United Kingdom Department for Transport's evaluation framework - NATA - is sufficiently capable of determining the likely value of investments in active travel, and hence whether there is confidence that policy-makers are adequately placed to make informed choices between alternative investments. It is argued that while the overarching logic to evaluating active travel remains relatively sound, changes must be made to the framework if a genuine transition to sustainable urban mobility is to occur."

Yet, CAS has a low cost-effectiveness and recovery potential and a high electricity demand and environmental footprint. By 2050, globally we have to solve severe water and phosphorus shortages while significantly decreasing greenhouse gas emissions. In this review and opinion paper, the ZeroWasteWater concept is proposed as a sustainable centralised technology train to short-cycle water, energy and valuable materials from sewage, while adequately abating pathogens, heavy metals and trace organics. Electrical energy recovery from anaerobic digestion of the organics present in sewage and kitchen waste (KW) has a value of 4.0 per inhabitant equivalent (IE) per year. In addition to sewerage improvements and water conservation, prerequisites include an advanced physico-chemical and/or biological concentration step at the entry of the sewage treatment plant. In the side stream, the recovery of phosphorus and carbon-sequestrating biochar from the digested sludge and of nitrogen from the digestate has a value of €6.3IE-1 year-1. Alternatively, recovery of biogas and materials can occur directly on source-separated black water. In the main stream, partial nitritation and anammox oxidise residual nitrogen. Moreover, two serial heat pumps recover thermal energy, valued at €6.9IE-1 year-1, cooling the water by 5°C, and membrane technologies recover potable water at €65IE-1 year-1. Interestingly, ZeroWasteWater is expected to be economically viable. Key steps are to incorporate water chain management into holistic urban planning and thus produce a cradle-to-cradle approach that society will find acceptable. © 2011 Taylor & Francis."

In terms of urban sustainability, such measures affect energy efficiency as well as environmental, economic and social aspects. Numerous publications dealt with such methodological approaches in the past, whilst the subject of sustainable urban areas and cities is constantly gaining interest. Furthermore, energy performance depends on building density, occupancy and consumer profile, climatic conditions, not least construction quality, factors linked, directly or not, to socioeconomic aspects. Greek cities are known for their density, their polymorphic structure and their complexity. Thus, planning energy conservation measures is a difficult task, demanding a precise methodological approach, which will embody most of these aspects to a great extent.

The urban maintenance theme can be considered as a real strategy for built environment sustainability; indeed, it is the primary tool for gaining knowledge about and governing the complex and heterogeneous contemporary reality, through which we can achieve system reliability, as well as sustainability regulating the life dimension. This contribution becomes an opportunity for reflecting within the technological culture of a maintenance project whose disciplinary discussion is today based on the application modes of such a discipline at both a building and an urban scale. Indeed, the methods and instruments for programming and maintaining the urban organism - intended as a complex unit system - cannot be those ones used for sub-systems and urban components; they have to be strategic instruments that are able to help managers and citizens to ""decide how to decide"". It is necessary to reach an integrated approach that, overcoming the logic of a technical management intended as a mere addition of parts, reaches systemic operating modes."

This condition makes it feasible to utilize both lignite and geothermal energy in a hybrid form for combined power heat, and cold generation, which may lead to optimally energy and exergy efficient, environmentally benign, and economically sound applications. This paper presents a novel concept of hybrid lignite-geothermal plant for a district energy system and hydrogen production facility in Aydin with special emphasis on high performance, green buildings and green districts. In this concept, lignite is first introduced to a partially fluidized-bed gasifier and then to a fluidized-bed gas cleaning unit, which produces synthetic gas and finally Hydrogen. The by-products, namely char and ash are used in a fluidized-bed combustor to produce power. Waste heat from all these steps are utilized in a district heating system along with heat received from geothermal production wells after power is generated there. H2S gas obtained from the separator system is coupled with hydrogen production process at the lignite plant. Absorption cooling systems and thermal storage tanks complement the hybrid system for the tri-generation district energy system. On the demand side, the new, green OSTIM OSB administration building in Ankara is exemplified for greener, low-exergy buildings that will compound the environmental benefits. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

The federal government has increased mitigation funding, but the process can be costly. Federal funds may not cover the price of mitigation efforts so local and state governments must find new methods of creating sustainable cities. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, it became apparent that in many locales, one major department was overlooked when emergency planning teams were created-human resources. In the days following the storm, local governments faced difficulties in contacting their employees and paying those who worked through the catastrophe. Although human resource management is an everyday occurrence in local government, in times of crisis, simple tasks may become difficult. By understanding six major vulnerabilities that local governments face, human resources departments can assist local governments not only in effective mitigation but also in creating a sustainable city. © SAGE Publications 2012."

This MSA is based on Substance Flow Analysis. It accounts for the flows of water, nitrogen, phosphorus, carbon, and energy into, around, and out of the water, energy, food, waste-handling, and forestry sectors of city-watershed systems. Applications of the MSA to two case studies of the Metropolitan Atlanta Area in Georgia, USA, and the Greater London Area, UK, are compared. The impacts and financial benefits are assessed for four candidate technological innovations in the water sector: urine-separating toilets; pyrolysis of sewage sludge; combined food-waste and wastewater conveyance/treatment; and production of algae-based biofuels from sewage. System-wide environmental sustainability is gauged on four accounts, of attaining progressively more ambitious targets of resource savings/recovery in respect of water, energy, and nutrients (both nitrogen- and phosphorus-based).

For this reason, the redesign of cities is essential in the transition towards sustainability. However, planning and designing sustainable neighbourhoods is not a simple task, given that there is no agreement on what the sustainable settlement should be, nor on how this should be achieved. Furthermore, planners have to strive to achieve a balance between financial, environmental, and social goals, and must deal with multiple actors and stakeholders and with site-specific character- istics. The aim of this work is to describe the key determining factorsöboth opportunities and constraintsöfound in the process of designing and planning a neighbourhood, based on a case study in the city of Barcelona. In this practical experiment, led by the authors, the ecodesign methodology was applied on an urban scale in the neighbourhood of Vallbona, Barcelona, which occupies an area of 32.6 ha and will host 2120 dwellings. From this neighbourhood ecodesign exercise, it was found that territorial (urban form, urban fabrics, and density; availability of local resources), financial, legal, and political (local government's wishes and leadership) determinants are the most important. It is concluded that there is no single path to achieve urban sustainability, since the design of neighbourhoods in different locations will lead to different results. © 2011 Pion Ltd and its Licensors."

Preservation, and restoring centers of antique cities already is the foremost task of modern city planning. The laws have already been passed and implemented which control this process. Right now is the time to pay attention to the non-monumental antique structures (NMAS) which are remote from the historical city center. They are the ones that are most vulnerable and are facing amendments. As a consequence of scientific-technological progress, with society developing at an increasing pace; cities evolve and grow fast, simultaneously with the changes within the functional structures of the separate micro districts. All these changes directly and inevitably affect the antique architectural structures. It is the historical objects and complexes located on the outskirts of the centers of the historical cities that are now isolated, and surrounded by newfangled structures. In many cities there are streets and micro districts which are no longer a single ensemble, as they were initially. Constructions abruptly differ from each other in styles and number of floors. This is the exact reason why preservation of a city's historical environment, and its cultural heritage, is one of the priorities of modern city planning. The purpose of this article is to develop a strategy to: • Assign a definition to structures not considered to be monuments of historical, archaeological, and artistic value, located on the outskirts of the city centers, as NMAS. • Locate NMAS in the present urban structures, and classify them conspicuous for their historical, archaeological, artistic or cultural interest. • Define their value. • Identify methods of preservation of NMAS according to their value. © 2010 WIT Press."

It is important to identify features of urban form that promote the health of city dwellers. Access to green space has been associated with health benefits at both individual and neighbourhood level. We investigated whether a relationship between green space coverage and selected mortality rates exists at the city level in the USA. Methods: An ecological cross-sectional study. A detailed land use data set was used to quantify green space for the largest US cities (n=49, combined population of 43 million). Linear regression models were used to examine the association between city-level 'greenness' and citylevel standardised rates of mortality from heart disease, diabetes, lung cancer, motor vehicle fatalities and all causes, after adjustment for confounders. Results: There was no association between greenness and mortality from heart disease, diabetes, lung cancer or automobile accidents. Mortality from all causes was significantly higher in greener cities. Conclusions: While considerable evidence suggests that access to green space yields health benefits, we found no such evidence at the scale of the American city. In the USA, greener cities tend also to be more sprawling and have higher levels of car dependency. Any benefits that the green space might offer seem easily eclipsed by these other conditions and the lifestyles that accompany them. The result merits further investigation as it has important implications for how we increase green space access in our cities."

Women's movements, indeed feminism itself, owe their beginnings to the stimulus of the urban environment. Research shows that it is in cities that women begin to move up the career ladder. But, when women have children they often move to the suburbs because they and their spouses conclude that cities are poor places to raise children: they are dangerous and dirty, with poor schools and inadequate child care support systems. Once children arrive, women pick up most of the housekeeping and child care burdens. Research shows that women's isolation in the suburbs, distance from work, and the obligations of childcare cause them to leave the workforce or land on something called the ""mommy track,"" now recognized as too often a road to career oblivion. But what if the cities were liveable and clean, with parks for children to play in, with safe and inviting neighbourhoods, good schools and all of the community supports that can come with urban density? What if women could benefit from the synergies of living near their professional peers, or being near women with similar career goals and challenges? Recent developments in urban planning for sustainability in the US, have and will have an impact on women's lives, especially career women with children for whom sustainable cities may offer the most clear path yet for successfully combining family and work. Also cities may become more sustainable in economic, social and environmental terms when women, building careers and raising families in cities, become part of the process as sustainable cities are developed. © 2012 WIT Press."

As we plan to deal with anthropogenic climate change, we talk of becoming more sustainable. We are projecting a sustainability vision; a certain future that we desire to achieve. In this paper I offer a Lacanian interpretation of this vision, arguing that we must understand how ideas such as the “sustainable city” operate as fantasy constructs. Here I want to emphasize the particular operation of this fantasy, since it is the very form of this operation that stymies the true politicization of climate change. The paper draws on Žižek's reading of Lacan to illustrate how sustainability (as fantasy) relates to our knowledge of climate change. Two brief illustrations of the operation of sustainability as fantasy are then outlined. The first draws on recent city planning in London, UK, to show how fantasy has gentrified the traumatic elements of climate change. The second illustration draws on a brief conversation with an urban policy-maker to sketch out how transgression is a functioning part of sustainability fantasies. In conclusion the paper turns to the question of politics through a relating of Lacan's psychoanalytical cure with a politicization of economy. © 2012 Institute for Human Geography."

However, momentous and when it comes to sustainability rather deleterious is evolving in the past five years or so: automobiles have flooded the city along with car-friendly policies being promulgated at both the central and local levels of government. Consequently, the market share of public transport has been substantially eroded since then. Apart from the rapid motorization that weakened Dalian's position as a green city, another factor fueling the downward trend of transit attractiveness has been the growing fragmentation in transit services. Given the fact that the motorization process is irreversible and restricting car purchase and use is unlikely to work out in China, if something needs to be done to maintain Dalian as a clean and comfortable living habitat, then lifting the fragmentation in the transit system is the only way to do this. Therefore, this paper explores where the fragmentation originates, and how it can be counteracted. A mathematical model is thus built to test the effectiveness of reducing fragmentation in improving transit service. And the results show that the modal split after system integration is going to tilt more strongly towards transit, while for service quality levels for users cannot expect much improvement. These modeling results have significant implications for the future public transport administration in Dalian. © 2012 Policy and Society Associates (APSS)."

These urban areas face competition from a wide range of destinations for the tourist's dollar and the investment necessary to develop world-class facilities. The nature of the tourist is changing very quickly making planning and management evermore a challenge. Many of the tourists are in fact first time visitors while others are from a younger generation of travellers with quite different expectations than their parents. There is also the recognition of the need to meet the needs of multiple cultures with their diverse lifestyles, religious beliefs and traditions. Given the rapid rise of tourism there has been a clear pattern of increased air pollution caused by the intensive use of vehicles for tourism/recreation-related mobility, pollution of water and marine ecosystems due to recreational navigation and peaks in the generation of solid and liquid wastes. It has been documented that tourism facilities are responsible for substantial increases in the consumption of fossil fuels for heating and electricity due to the visitors' rising quality expectations for services and facilities. Poorly planned and managed tourism destinations disturb birds feeding habitats and wildlife, cause land erosion and damage to vegetation which leads to erosion in ecologically sensitive areas.

Tied into a global network of exchange, it exists principally as a place of financial speculation and transaction. It is marked by a parallel economy of culture, which underpins a re-conceptualisation and spatial re-formation of the city. Despite its widespread currency, criticisms have challenged its economic sustainability. Further questions have contested its tendency to impose a singular, homogenized space prioritizing consumption while marginalising other concerns. Post-independence Riga's recent experience provides a platform from which to critique the global city paradigm, which the city embraced as it sought to embed itself in the West not only politically but culturally and economically as well. In opposition to this model's intrinsic singular emphasis and exclusionary tendencies, this text will explore the concept of palimpsest; this proposition understands the city as a multiplicity of layers, within which convergences and divergences offer a site from which to generate synergies. This will be framed in reference to recent discourse on the sustainable city and development practice. Recent design-led inquiry situated in the context of Riga will then provide a lens on palimpsest as an alternative form of praxis."

Using the 2003-2005 Australian Federal Government's House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Heritage's Inquiry into Sustainable Cities as a case study the paper employs a discursive approach to analyse the Inquiry documents. The paper argues that use of the word sprawl has powerful metaphorical importance in sustainable city discourse, suggesting alternative stories about the future of cities. The first, the story of decline, suggests out of control growth of cities that threatens not only the resource base, but also 'nature', agricultural land and social stability. It also leads to isolation, loneliness, boredom, crime, obesity and a whole litany of other evils. The alternative storyline, the story of control, is presented as the only choice 'we' really have - the compact, contained city is a place where resources are used wisely, 'nature' and agricultural land are protected, and there is a sense of 'community'. However, it is the contention of this paper that the dominant focus on sprawl in sustainable city discourse effectively closes down rather than opens up discussion about the future because embedded in the use of the term sprawl is a predefined conclusion. In addition, the abundant use of pronouns in the discussion paper, the inquiry and in sustainability literature more broadly - 'we, 'our', 'us' - all denote a common responsibility and a common pathway that encourages compliance, not the active and open ended involvement of citizens in shaping their future. © 2010 WIT Press."

Results show that most alleys in Los Angeles are underutilized and walkable, quiet, and clean, although they can be, and are often perceived as, dirty and unsafe.

The sustainability of city systems therefore depends upon complex, cross-scale interactions between the natural system, the transboundary engineered infrastructures, and the multiple social actors and institutions that govern these infrastructures. These elements, we argue, are best studied in an integrated manner using a novel social-ecological-infrastructural systems (SEIS) framework. In the biophysical subsystem, the SEIS framework integrates urban metabolism with life cycle assessment to articulate transboundary infrastructure supply chain water, energy, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission footprints of cities. These infrastructure footprints make visible multiple resources (water, energy, materials) used directly or indirectly (embodied) to support human activities in cities. They inform cross-scale and cross-infrastructure sector strategies for mitigating environmental pollution, public health risks and supply chain risks posed to cities. In the social subsystem, multiple theories drawn from the social sciences explore interactions between three actor categories-individual resource users, infrastructure designers and operators, and policy actors-who interact with each other and with infrastructures to shape cities toward sustainability outcomes. Linking of the two subsystems occurs by integrating concepts, theories, laws, and models across environmental sciences/climatology, infrastructure engineering, industrial ecology, architecture, urban planning, behavioral sciences, public health, and public affairs. Such integration identifies high-impact leverage points in the urban SEIS. An interdisciplinary SEIS-based curriculum on sustainable cities is described and evaluated for its efficacy in promoting systems thinking and interdisciplinary vocabulary development, both of which are measures of effective frameworks. © 2012 by Yale University."

Brownfields sites remain idle in part because of the threat of liability for brownfields developers under CERCLA or its state analogues. The consequences of this threat include the migration of jobs and tax revenues to suburban 'greenfields' locations. Thus, states and the federal government are developing and implementing policies designed to promote the redevelopment of brownfields sites, such as voluntary cleanup programs, prospective purchaser agreements, innovative funding arrangements, and so forth. But which brownfields programs will really lead to sustainable cities? Perhaps all, perhaps none; no one can say for sure. Any argument that all brownfields redevelopment is inherently sustainable is unjustified. As I demonstrate in Part II, for example, a brownfields program that deemphasizes the role of public participation is not 'sustainable development'. Moreover, without a hard law of sustainable development, we must be skeptical about any program's claim to sustainability. In this article, I develop a framework for thinking of brownfields policies as a cornerstone of our nascent sustainable development law. My analysis begins in Part I with a short summary of brownfields law and policy, and a description of our current understanding of 'sustainable development.' There is no hard and fast definition of the term, but it is increasingly more clear that a body of sustainable development 'law' will take shape as the product of a host of decisions made now and in the near future."

From the incorporation of energy modelling performance into building regulations, to the concepts and principles of Transit Oriented Development, sustainability terminology now litters both international and national policy environments.

This paper focuses on the progress to date in housing environmental performance assessment, and compares the energy performance of Australian housing with that in the UK, United States and Canada. The comparison is based on energy ratings of over fifty house designs currently being used which comply with regulatory requirements in the host countries. Issues in design of both the buildings and the assessment tool used are highlighted, and the results of this large Australian Government-funded study are presented. Analysis allows conclusions to be drawn on the reasons for wide variations in house energy (and environmental) performance, and the implications for sustainable cities. A review of design guides and assessment tools aimed at the building and urban scales is also undertaken, including the prospects for new Australian building assessment tools such as AccuRate, BASIX and the Australian Green Building Council's 'Green Star' suite of tools. International comparisons are drawn, and critical analysis is undertaken of the limitations of such tools. Prospects for the incorporation of ESD principles into the planning and design of sustainable cities are presented."

What is the essence of the city in generating development, on the one hand, and of environmental problems, on the other hand? How have the relations between town and countryside been shaped and how are these relationships connected to sustainability of town and countryside? What exactly do we mean by sustainability? What are the factual environmental problems of Third World urban and metropolitan areas, and what are the practical solutions implemented inthese areas? We do not pretend to be able to solve the pressing social issues implied in these questions, but merely hope to supply some thoughts to give food for further reflection."

Many developers, contractors, and property managers emphasize their deep commitment to sustainable building and sustainable management. But in practice little progress has been made in this area so far. The environmental impact of the use and upkeep of cities is guesswork. This paper identifies strategies to make cities sustainable and to realize an ecological breakthrough. The strategies are presented in terms of the chain of environmental impacts. Urban systems are depicted as a confluence of areas, material flows, and actors. The ecological features of an area affect its environmental quality. Actors have to cooperate and to take initiatives to promote sustainability. Many environmental effects caused by urban activities are connected to flows of energy, resources, water, waste material, air pollution, and traffic. Specific environmental investments are needed to develop more sustainable urban systems."

This international initiative involves seventeen partners from nine European countries, representing important stakeholders with interests in urban development. The primary objective of the project is the development and implementation of a general City Concept comprising a toolbox of improved technologies and processes, together with decision-making and management tools, for sustainable urban renewal, focusing on contaminated buildings, in order to protect the environment from hazardous compounds and save reusable buildings and materials. This paper presents the main focal points of the project, including contamination assessment, health and safety of construction and demolition workers, reduction of waste and preservation of buildings and resources. The holistic purpose of the project is to respond to some of the most important challenges of urban development, such as rehabilitation of old buildings, minimisation of waste and recycling of materials. Within this general context, focus is placed on the main outcome of the project, namely a model for an integrated management system called City Concept. The model serves as a management support tool for activities and processes related to the decontamination and rehabilitation of urban structures and buildings, including demolition, cleansing of surfaces and materials and recycling and reuse of recycled materials."

By examining the case study of the Australian city of Newcastle, the paper provides a context for a general debate about the urban design of a sustainable city centre, and discusses how urban design is affected (and can be expected to be even more affected in future) by the new paradigms of ecology. In this context, the author presents the case study of 'SolarCity', which is based on a vision for the revitalisation of Newcastle's city centre. It is an in-progress research and demonstration project, involving Australian and German architects, engineers and industry partners. It deals with cross-cutting issues in architecture and urban design and addresses the question: How to best cohesively integrate all aspects of energy systems, transport systems, waste and water management, climatisation, etc., into contemporary urban design and the environmental performance of eco-buildings? The 'SolarCity' project encapsulates a vision based on the belief that urban revitalisation can be achieved and facilitated through the use of sustainable urban design principles. Consequently, this paper addresses the fundamentals of urban sustainability, such as orientation to the sun, and general strategies for more compact communities. As we begin to fully understand the consequences of our dependency on fossil energy and the automobile, the cost of mobility, and ways to integrate sustainability systems into buildings, it becomes apparent that the common knowledge of aesthetics of urban composition is no longer sufficient."

How environmental factors structure urban form and function is another question, but the key relationship on which to focus in an environmental approach to urbanism is that between the individual and the environment, and not between a culture or society as a system and the environment. At another level, one could argue that there is no such thing as tropical urbanism. The relationships that constitute ecological processes are the same throughout the biosphere, and it is only the outcome of these processes that is different in the tropics. Likewise, the “rules” of the development of complexity, associated with urbanism everywhere, are about power relationships and hierarchy more than setting or conditions. In addition to these themes, I reconsider the conditions for Maya urbanism, and I suggest a range of alternative relationships that can inform urban processes and outcomes. © 1999 Wiley Publisher.

Their existence, however, was materially erased from the city and discursively erased from its history after that period. This paper investigates the processes of that erasure, particularly in the American Addition neighborhood of Columbus, concentrating on the articulation of an urban normative that made such land uses appear contrary to ""modern"" urban development. At the same time, the existence of such practices and landscapes in the city was explained away by a crisis narrative of the garden that helped to support the idea that such practices did not produce ""normal"" urban spaces. The simultaneous material and discursive colonization of subsistence gardens as ""relief"" measures during the Great Depression left these landscapes and areas depend on the City of Columbus, under whose control they were transformed into more ""appropriate"" cityscapes.

This issue has been the focus of many researchers and several studies have been carried out in order to find the closest city form to the ethos of sustainability. Efficiency is one of the main key issues closely related to the sustainable city agenda. Since the concept of sustainable city is highly contextual, this study is concerned with the investigation of the applicability of sustainable city paradigm, in terms of efficiency, to the old city of Jerusalem. Investigation is limited to one major theoretical area, city form; and two minor theoretical areas, street system and land use. In order to carry out the investigation, the study used different methods (multi-method approach) consisting of content analysis and field survey, thus, incorporating the triangulation method in data analysis. The use of different methods was inspired by the very nature of the data collected, and the local context of Jerusalem. Also, the adoption of different methods compensated for the limited sources of data and provided strength for each method. The findings provide evidence that the parameter 'efficiency' of the sustainable city paradigm is applicable to the old city of Jerusalem with respect to the city's form and street system, but this is not the case for land use. The criteria and indicators that were not applicable identified a number of problems in the functioning of the city. The paradigm characterized is not a healing recipe or a blueprint. Rather, it is a flexible framework or a vision out of many others and, thus, disputable. This study provides an approach, out of many others, to investigate the applicability of the sustainable city paradigm on Arabic-Islamic cities in general and the old city of Jerusalem in particular. This approach provides a flexible framework for officials and planners to work through and vision each city's own version of sustainability. © 2007."

This methodology can help city planners to determine and localize problems of urban fabric density, to enhance motivation and versatility of decisions. For evaluation of city compactness efficiency attributes and the weights of it based on expert judgment are established. This model is applied to Kaunas city. On the basis of GIS the data bank of population, public transport stops and places of public attraction is prepared.

This paper discusses ten critical responses to this issue and summarizes them in a simple conceptual model that places the nexus between transport and urban form at the heart of developing an eco-city. This involves compact, mixed-use urban form, well-defined higher-density, human-oriented centres, priority to the development of superior public transport systems and conditions for non-motorized modes, with minimal road capacity increases, and protection of the city's natural areas and food-producing capacity. These factors form the framework in which everything else is embedded and must operate, and if they are not addressed only marginal changes in urban sustainability can be made. Within this framework, environmental technologies need to be extensively applied. Economic growth needs to emphasize creativity and innovation and to strengthen the environmental, social and cultural amenities of the city. The public realm throughout the city needs to be of a high quality, and sustainable urban design principles need to be applied in all urban development. All these dimensions need to operate within two key processes involving vision-oriented and reformist thinking and a strong, community-oriented, democratic sustainability framework for decision-making.

Its Roman baths and Georgian architecture draw nearly 4 million visitors each year. The cultural attractions of the city have also led to much recent in-migration and Bath is under increasing pressure to meet residents' demands for affordable accommodation, transport and services. Physical, political and economic constraints mean that development is very difficult to carry out sustainably. Bath is located in the steep-sided Avon valley and there is little flat land available for large-scale development. Furthermore, as well as having a protected historic core, Bath is surrounded by green belt, which restricts urban sprawl, in this case towards nearby Bristol and surrounding towns. To the east, much of the countryside falls in the Cots-wolds Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, limiting development to village infill. As a consequence, Bath has a real shortage of affordable housing (even lower than the nationally low figure for the south-west of 16% of the total housing stock) but also needs to safeguard land for industrial development as it is over-reliant on the fickle tourist sector."

The third section then considers some of the problems of unsustainability faced by the citizens of Edinburgh. Some of these problems are bequeathed by earlier periods of urban development and others are contemporary in nature. These problems include social exclusion and poverty; economic development problems associated with housing, employment and related transport congestion and land uses; and ecological problems concerned with maintaining natural capital and human capital in a changing urban milieu. Whilst many of the social, economic and ecological problems are specific to Edinburgh, they are also common to other cities in Western Europe. Section four describes some of the new ways in which these problems are being addressed under the tutelage of the Lord Provost's Commission on Sustainable Development in an attempt to make Edinburgh an exemplar of sustainable urban development.

The paper stresses the need to include social and economic factors when analyzing urban landscapes. Spatially explicit data can be used to assess the roles different green areas have in providing people with ecosystem services, and whether people actually have access to the services.

However, without an adequate framework within which to address relevant issues, there may be no legacy for the next generation in most cities. This paper makes an attempt at highlighting a framework through which an urban center could be established and administered within the arid regions. The first part looks at the general background and concepts of sustainable development while the second part highlights the characteristics of the arid regions and the pertinent issues that warrant the adoption of sustainable development. The third part draws from the various concepts, to generate a general framework that can be applied in any part of the arid regions with little or minimal adjustment. The fourth part makes a passing survey of some regions and cities, which have made use of sustainable development approaches in trying to solve relevant problems of cultural interaction, energy and the economic challenges.

"'Eco-city' to 'disaster-resilient eco-community': A concerted approach in the coastal city of Puri, India","2008","10.1007/s11625-008-0051-3","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-56049088278&doi=10.1007%2fs11625-008-0051-3&partnerID=40&md5=9b1cb61faa888ff3c3d01823490d2147","The need for environmental and urban planning reached a critical point in the year 2007, when one-half of the world's population could be defined as living in cities. Urbanisation in India is also increasing at a fast rate. Urban chaos in India, emanating from the continuous ignorance of fragile ecosystems, calls for the reshaping of existing cities as 'eco-cities'. The 'eco-city' - a well-known concept in the western world - is new to the Indian context. While western connotations of eco-cities should not be discarded outright in the context of India, core concerns vary significantly for obvious reasons. Recognising two facts - firstly, eco-city development is altogether a fresh approach to human settlement development in India, and, secondly, the manifold increase in the vulnerability of cities - this paper discusses documented good practice, reinforcing evolution towards the eco-city vision. Lessons drawn from the examples cited are further deconstructed in the light of their contribution to urban risk reduction, which provides direction to appreciating the 'disaster-resilient eco-community' concept in Puri, a coastal city in India. Further, this paper attempts to unravel existing community-based practices in Puri, which are boon to the local environment and invariably reduce disaster risk. These seemingly modest neighbourhood initiatives symbolise immense societal wealth, which can be calibrated appropriately for reducing urban environmental risk as well. This paper also illustrates how a 'disaster resilient eco-community' approach is inevitable in the present and future contexts not only to preserve sustainable development gains but also to secure human well-being. © Integrated Research System for Sustainability Science and Springer 2008."

They are engines for the economic growth of nations. Expanding cities have created a number of socio-economic and environmental problems. They consume vast amounts of water, food, fuel, land, vegetation, minerals and metals, and produce large amounts of wastes and pollutants. For the sustainable management of 'eco-cities', environmentally friendly building designs and construction materials have to be developed and technological changes made to manufacture eco-automobiles. Cities are our common future; there will be no return to a pre-industrial world. The challenge is to organise large urban areas which allow for the efficient use of energy and resources, non-polluting vehicles, safe management of city wastes, job opportunities, commerce and trade."

They also bring up ethical, social, and cultural issues, and they impact the local community - their social needs and what the neighborhoods can gain from creating a new tall building. As with the buildings themselves, the urban context in which tall buildings have evolved has changed dramatically since their Chicago origins, reflecting both social and technological developments. A tall building has been variously called a ""city within a city,"" ""a vertical city,"" and a ""city in the sky."" Thus it is apparent that a tall building is a microcosm of a large city. It is an integral part of the urban habitat having a close relationship with it. In a way it is a vertical progression of a horizontal city. The two are interactive and connected by the transportation, power grid, water supply, and waste production and disposal systems. The tall building can therefore play a vital role in defining livable and sustainable cities. Both cities and skyscrapers must use fewer natural resources; create less waste; and impact less on the natural world. Technology will continue to improve the physical systems of the skyscraper and the city; however, their future will be defined by human interests and values."

The survey focused on entropy, water circulation and biological diversity. First the temperature rise may be continued by a high ratio of commercial areas developed with high density in terms of entropy. Second the underground development in high density built-up areas and the high ratio of impermeable pavement were analyzed as water- circulation. Lastly, although the ratio of forest and river biotope was high, those were distributed in the suburbs of Seoul and were artificially established. In addition, the damp areas which had critical functions as habitats in the city were distributed on a small-scale. Therefore, as the direction of energy circulation plan, 7 detailed planning items were required as follows: the improvement of roadside's trees and green spaces, the formation of brook street, tree-planting in the school's playground, an extension and new formation of children's park green space, tree-planting around public institutions and religious facilities, tree-planting on roofs and walls, an increase in green space around apartment complexes and the establishment of environment-ecological planning. In terms of water circulation; ecological restoration of artificial rivers, security of rainfall reservoir and establishment of residential area with satisfactory water circulation were suggested. Also, improvement plans for the biological diversity must be established by classifying into the three parts; the security of the biological habitats, the formation of urban ecological axis and the activation of ecological culture. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

The concept of speed in the image of the city is so important among optimal and multidisciplinary living styles. Recently life styles are strongly affected by the concept of speed and therefore the designing process in the scale of city planning has started to be based on that factor. This is also the case in the newly developing cities. Speed will be analyzed by the ecological statement of the city, transportation, visual perception and recognition, aesthetical needs, multifunctional usages of common spaces and the formation and orientation of city centers in the sustainable cities. Speed is the basic principle in artificial intelligence. In this study, the speed factor with some examples on sustainable developed cities and criticizing this factor by making proposals will be discussed. Ankara, the capital city of Turkey, will also be analyzed. Showing examples of speed in city life style will bring together contemporary solutions as a result of this study. The most important thing is to mention the speed factor together with regular, comfortable and peaceful relaxing spaces. The ideal combination of speed and comfort is the basic aim of the study. The term speed does not only refer to transportation or time factor but also to the multidisciplinary and flexible usage of surroundings as well as aesthetic value and visual recognition."

The problematique of urban sustainability is studied in the historical and international context. Current research in the field is reviewed, and major gaps in interdisciplinary analysis are identified. The paper makes first steps towards the development of an innovative methodology for the analysis of interdisciplinary linkages among various sustainability dimensions in the urban context. The dimensions taken into consideration are: sustainable energy, sustainable transport, material flows and waste management, quality of life, health, psychology of interaction with the environment, green space, biodiversity, preservation of the natural and cultural heritage, landscape architecture, ecodesign and democratic participation. Two large European cities, London and St Petersburg, are analysed from the point of view of integrative policies and instruments applied in the field of sustainable urban development. The two cities are compared using a panel of sustainability indicators. Copyright © 2009 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd."

Much less attention is being paid to that type of nature close to where people live and work, to small-scale green areas in cities and to their benefits to people. Increasing empirical evidence, however, indicates that the presence of natural areas contributes to the quality of life in many ways. Besides many environmental and ecological services, urban nature provides important social and psychological benefits to human societies, which enrich human life with meanings and emotions. The main concern of this paper is to address the importance of urban nature for citizens' well being and for the sustainability of the city they inhabit. Some results of a survey conducted among visitors of an urban park in Amsterdam (The Netherlands) are presented and discussed. The issues investigated concern people's motives for urban nature, the emotional dimension involved in the experience of nature and its importance for people's general well being. Results confirm that the experience of nature in urban environment is source of positive feelings and beneficial services, which fulfill important immaterial and non-consumptive human needs. Implications for the sustainability of the city will be analyzed and discussed. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

It is becoming increasingly clear that there are a number of different approaches being considered. This article develops four models of sustainable urban development from this literature, ranging from light green to deep green in their underlying environmental philosophy. The models are then used as the framework for analysing four different experiments in sustainable urban development in the city of Adelaide, South Australia, which broadly fit into the four models. Overall, the models are useful in highlighting the different underlying rationales of the four approaches, although they also show that in the process of trying to gain political favour there is a fair amount of 'ideological capture' in respect of the rhetorics and the practice of sustainable urban development."

Sustainable development is a widely accepted strategic framework in city planning and urban parks play an important role in it. Nonetheless, it is argued, that urban parks and other open green spaces are important for the quality of life of an increasingly urbanized society. Following the industrial revolution with its massive urbanisation in the 19th century and the explosive growth of urban areas and nature degradation throughout the 20th century, the alienation between people and nature was increased. The urban park movement had objective to increase life quality in the modern city. Sustainability and city regeneration strategies focus mainly on man-made and built components of the urban environment, although, in the last years is noticed an increasing interest for development of nature in cities. In order to exemplify the importance of urban parks for sustainability and the future of the city this paper analyses some emblematic projects that marked the urban park movement in their construction period - the Central Park, the Park Amsterdamse Bos, the Park André-Citröen and the City Park of Porto. The role that urban green space play in ecological, social and economic sustainability will be discussed and the case study of the new City Park of Portimão will address the importance of urban green spaces for life quality and sustainable city development."

The cheap labour and informal goods and services which this badly-housed population provides is an important ingredient in the city's prosperity. The dilemma which many larger cities around the world are facing thus repeats itself in Ayutthaya, at a smaller scale, in which the city needs the poor's cheap labour but has been unable to acknowledge their needs regarding secure housing and basic services. So the question in recent years has been how can all stakeholders work together to improve the situation in the city? How can they create a healthy city? The healthy city concept not only concentrates on the health and well-being of the middle- and upper-class segments of the population, in the conventional sense, but also tries to create opportunities for all groups of people to develop and perform all the functions of life. Low-income communities can initiate joint development activities with other civic groups, specializing in bottom-up development in many forms, i.e., savings and credit, community welfare, communities surveys, and the type of environmental and housing development that can lead to real participation and development of a healthy city for all citizens. Low-income housing development for a healthy city in Ayutthaya is a case that brings interorganizational linkages and responsibility-sharing among community organizations, community networks, local and central government agencies, public organizations, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in the implementation process, based on the idea that poor people can reside in the city in mutually beneficial ways. This is an ongoing project which has created two to three demonstration communities to show various possible solutions."

It is depicted as one of the more significant foundations for building greater equity in the distribution of public resources and social capital, even as the ""Not In My Backyard"" (NIMBY) syndrome often paralyzes public action through community disengagement from larger obligations. Its contradictory nature reflects its place in everyday life as, on the one hand, defined by its familiarity and special distinction to residents, but on the other as a commodity for the real estate industry and individual property owners. The real contested character of the neighbourhood however makes it the ideal setting for examining, experimenting with, and implementing a coherent program of sustainability. This paper examines the modern character of the neighbourhood, its roots in garden cities, its three distinct formations, and the challenge to its authenticity as either no more than a sentimental abstraction with no social meaning or one whose limited legitimacy is undermined by continuing privatization and the hyper technological connectivity of individual life. The neighbourhood is a place that can support more indigenous economies, sustainable technologies and infrastructure, and genuine forms of public participation, as part of the renewal of contemporary cities."

Design/methodology/approach - Research has been based on a review of the literature, which has been collected from books, journals, reports and soft-materials of the internet. A simple descriptive analytical approach is followed to examine the argument. The paper argues that a sustainable city should not be a goal, but a principle of effective service provisions based on social equity and justice. Findings - Despite the main premise that a sustainable city is to achieve environmental, social and economic sustainability, the concept is widely criticised due to its disputable application in the cities of the South. The paper suggests that the sustainable city discourse does not include the main problems of the cities in the global South, even though, as a goal, it is efficient and effective in the developed countries of the global North. Thus, the paper concludes that a goal-based sustainable city discourse of the global North will be misleading and inappropriate for the sustainable urban development in the cities of the global South. Originality/value - Despite the widespread application of the sustainable city concept in developing countries, cities are facing numerous social, economic and environmental problems. Realising this fact, it is imperative to investigate the root-causes of the problems. In line with this thinking, the paper offers a conceptual framework to analyse urban development policies in the cities of the global South. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

Cities are the drivers of economic activity; however, the quality of life the city offers in terms of environmental, physical, social and cultural development are becoming increasingly critical in both attracting and retaining inhabitants in a knowledge-based economic order. Providing such an all encompassing quality of life at the local level requires a system of governance that can both relate to the needs and desires of inhabitants, and have the ability to act upon them - in order to promote a more sustainable living environment. This necessitates a system of strong urban governance based upon the principles of subsidiarity in a partnership model to provide the political leadership and dynamism needed to achieve more sustainable cities for the benefit of all inhabitants.

This process took place as part of the ""Sustainable Cities, First Stage"" - SC-1S. The hazard maps, land use planning, and priority projects to reduce the vulnerability of the city facilities were unanimously approved by the communities involved and all local government council members. Investigations into the effects of the Arequipa, Peru, earthquake of June 23, 2001, were performed to take advantage of this unique opportunity to find out just how useful preevent studies are in reducing disasters. In this case a regional seismic scenario (RSS) had been constructed from 1992 to 1995 for Peru's southwestern region. The macroseismic area of the June 2001 event overlapped substantially with this RSS. The other main objective of the comparison between the RSS and the effects of the real event was to validate the application of hazard maps in land use planning to reduce losses caused by intense natural events. It was estimated that relatively low acceleration on rock occurred over extensive areas, but this was greatly amplified on soft water-saturated soil, unstable slopes, and uncompacted filled soil. As those were the places where the RSS assumed that the earthquake damage would be severe, the predicted locations of the RSS coincided with the locations that were the worst hit by the June 2001 earthquake. In this paper, comparison is made between the 1992-1995 RSS and the effects of the Arequipa June 2001 earthquake, to verify how useful predisaster investigations are and to validate the seismic hazard maps employed in land-use planning for disaster reduction, which have been widely applied in Peru in the SC-1S program over the past three years. © 2002 American Society of Civil Engineers."

It does so by examining the motives, behaviour and preferences of a sample of households moving house within the owner-occupied sector in the Cardiff region of South Wales. The findings suggest that most relocating households prefer, and actively seek to move to, less sustainable detached or semi-detached housing with private gardens, often in suburban locations. Apartment living and city centre and dockland locations are rarely preferred. Access to facilities in mixed land use areas appears not to be a prominent concern for many. To reconcile these results with the apparent buoyancy of housing markets in central city and dockland locations, the characteristics and preferences of residents in these areas are examined."

"Researching the sustainable city: Three modes of interdisciplinarity","2006","10.1068/a37317","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33745778018&doi=10.1068%2fa37317&partnerID=40&md5=caf17102851dda1ccc141534695935f4","In this paper we explore the practice of interdisciplinarity by examining how the UK research councils addressed the problem of the sustainable city during the 1990s. In developing their research programmes, the councils recognised that the problems of the sustainable city transcended conventional disciplinary boundaries and that an interdisciplinary approach was needed. In practice, however, initially radical proposals to research the city as a complex combination of science and technology and society contracted into more cognate collaborations that emphasised either science or technology or society, with the result that interdisciplinarity came to be located within research councils rather than between them. This, in turn, led to the development of a third kind of interdisciplinarity as the responsibility for making the connections between the research programmes was outsourced to the user communities - the local authorities. Unfortunately, local authorities struggled to find the resources to conduct this work so that the radical interdisciplinarity recommended at the start of the decade remained unaccomplished at the end. In describing these events we emphasise roles of paradigms and epistemic cultures in shaping research approaches and the complications they raise for the triangulation between approaches that is assumed in the idea of interdisciplinarity. We do not wish to be entirely negative, however, and conclude by suggesting some ways in which the quality and success of this much-needed interdisciplinary work could be increased. © 2006 a Pion publication printed in Great Britain."

Why? In every modern society they represent up to 20% of the population. Their number is now increasing due to medical advances, causing an increasing economic burden on society. Yet they have the right to dignity, socio-economic opportunities, inclusion and participation to socio economic development and opportunities. An extended working life and independent access to city resources would reduce such problems. This Paper describes comprehensive research undertaken in Pretoria, South Africa proposing substantial changes to commonly accepted city environments (in relation to urban design, infrastructure provision and utilization of services) into 'Intelligent Enabling Environments', where disabled and aged people would be provided with user-friendly wearable computing devices, connected to a wireless, distributed and invisible two/multi-way data transmission system, able to allow access 'on-the-go' of useful data related to buildings, urban infrastructure and services, and to transmit also user's personal data. Data would include information on public buildings (location, accessibility, services provided), events, accessible city routes, info on public transport and relevant navigational data. Users would be automatically 3D tracked and the display of information would be' hands-free' and embedded in flexible wearable devices in personal clothing, or as part of miniaturized head-mounted-devices, customized to provide also audible information in multiple languages. Information would be accessed through interactive menus, designed around users' life-styles, activities, education and valid both in a first and a third-world urban design context; it would be transmitted and received within enabled 'smart buildings' and also through an urban wireless system, via satellite and/or hot-spots. The design of future cities would be affected, revolutionized and made more effective, therefore sustainable. This paper explores the research methodology followed and the results obtained. The project has embraced current research on innovative futuristic technologies and focuses on a 'Technology Demonstrator' executed in a city block in the city of Pretoria."

Perhaps the most elegant definition of sustainable development yet devised is that by planner Scott Campbell. His definition is illustrated by a simple equilateral triangle in which the competing demands of the three Es - environmental protection, economic development, and social equity-occupy the triangle's corners. The three Es have been conceptually related by a public discourse associated with the environmental movement over the past thirty years. What is novel about Campbell's contribution to this discourse is the triangulated structure of the three variables and his proposal that correspondingly, a series of three rational conflicts occupy the triangle's sides. Campbell's point is that sustainable development lies at the geometric centre of the triangle and can be achieved only by negotiating and thus balancing the dynamic conflicts that naturally exist between the networks of interest nested in each corner. Although Campbell's definition is extremely helpful, we will argue that it does not go quite far enough. Implicit in Campbell's logic is the idea that sustainable development is a discursive mode of conflict resolution. Such an activity, we argue, is inherently democratic because it assumes that citizens in conflict will rationally resolve their disputes in public space. To develop further this hypothesis we rely on the description of Strong Democracy developed by the political philosopher, Benjamin Barber.2 Barber argues that the history of Western liberal democracy is constituted of three dispositions - anarchism, realism, and minimalism. In this political taxonomy, each liberal disposition distinguishes itself by opting for alternative modes of conflict resolution: anarchists tend to deny the existence of conflict, realists tend to suppress it, and minimalists tend to tolerate it. This distinction will be further developed below. © 2003 The Journal of Architecture."

In fact last April, the government advised that aged and patients should stay indoors due to worsening pollution. To see whether pollution and waste can be reduced or even eliminated, the Chinese government pushed through with the development of what it calls the world's first eco-city. Designed by the London-based global consulting firm Arup Group, Dongtan (as the new city will be called) is to be built on an island near Shanghai. In addition to banning all polluting cars, Dongtan will dig canals for waterways. The city will recycle as much as possible, grow food on its own environmentally sensitive farms and create all of its own energy in nonpolluting ways. Chinese officials hope Dongtan will offer practical lessons about pollution control and sustainability that can be applied to Shanghai proper, as well as to their other rapidly growing urban areas."

The chances of successful governance increase when governance arrangements are better tuned to the environment that it tries to change. However, a better fit leaves less room for change. Governance arrangements supporting sustainable development are more prone to failure, as they aim at changing that environment. Radical institutional change is at the core of sustainable development, but without the help of external factors, such as major crises like the oil crisis in the 1970s, the sense of urgency for such radical change is lacking, and incremental change seems to be the only road available. The authors explore how governance arrangements deal with this recurring barrier to institutional change. Their conclusion is that the more governance arrangements respect the institutional context in which they are used, the higher their quality. To speed up the incremental track, the design of governance arrangements should include positive incentives for actors to cooperate."

Design/methodology/approach - The study has been carried out as action research. Using innovation and user-producer interaction as the framework, the authors present the development process; the structure, contents and methodology of the programme; and report on their research findings. Findings - UQDM is dependent on human resource development, institutionalised networks and confident exchange of knowledge, and must identify and incorporate multiple environmental, social, economic and cultural aspects. The authors find that at the core of innovative societies, an interlinkage exists between practice (business, civil society, governance) and theory (research, education). The case illustrates how a new curriculum takes time to develop and implement and how it relies on confidence and trust between partners, in this case cities and universities, before being able to plant the seed for a sustainable response to the needs of city administrations. University consortia may be particularly useful as providers of a broad framework and an enabling setting in which diffusion of innovation can occur. Practical implications - The paper presents a successful approach to developing new curricula. Basing itself on user-producer interaction within the framework of innovation and innovation theory, the programme addresses urban quality through a multi-disciplinary and inter-institutional collaboration between city administrations and universities. Per se, the approach is easily replicable but will require time, effort and dedication by all involved, both during development and in later execution. Originality/value - The paper reports on a new, unique programme and further places the development of the curriculum and the curriculum itself explicitly in the context of user-producer interaction and with innovation as the framework. While this framework is widely used both descriptively and prescriptively in product development, it has seemingly yet to be applied extensively for other types of developments, including university educations. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

In a similar vein, the paper suggests widespread support for the idea of 'smart growth' as a form of 'sustainable urban growth' capable of advancing the end of sustainable cities. The purpose of the paper is to make the case for the intrinsically unsustainable nature of economic and urban growth. Included among the results of the paper are references to publications from the 1990s and the current decade revealing mounting evidence of existent ecological limits to growth.

Because the social, economic, ecological and institutional development of a city are increasingly interwoven, city management has become a complex enterprise. Management of complex systems such as cities requires the use of innovative, sophisticated planning tools that can assist in monitoring current conditions and projecting future developments. It also requires a well-structured participatory process of creating social support by stakeholders for long-term city visions. In this paper an integrated approach is proposed towards: (i) the development and implementation of a generic city planning tool that in principle can be applied to any kind of city. The proposed tool is a combination of an information system and a dynamic model, which enables the instrument to be used in both strategic and operational manners; and (ii) the development of long-term integrated visions for a more sustainable city through a participatory trajectory in which the integrated city planning tool can be supportive in developing stakeholder-based long-term visions for a more sustainable future of cities. To illustrate the planning tool for sustainable cities the case for Maastricht, a middle-size town in the Netherlands, is described, which will be carried out in the next 3 years. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

Major energy savings can be made from modal shifts in the transport sector, and with efficient lighting. The savings make a contribution to economic development, by freeing up resources. The savings from energy efficiency also have important social benefits in energy savings, reducing energy bills for poor households. From an environmental point of view, implementing the city's renewable energy target will have significant costs, but these can be partly off-set by selling carbon credits through the Clean Development Mechanism, and will result in indirect health benefits. Targeted interventions can reduce local air pollution, and help Cape Town become a leader in addressing greenhouse gas emissions. Apart from examining the social, economic and environmental dimensions of each policy, this paper compares policies to one another. Of particular interest for sustainable energy development are those policies which are viable in terms of costs, social benefits and the environment. Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs) in residential, commercial and government sectors and heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) in commerce and government sectors stand out as policies that have benefits from every angle. The paper builds on previous work done on the 'state of energy' for Cape Town and develops a tool that can paint a picture of what might happen to energy in the future. Using the Long-Range Energy Alternatives Planning (LEAP) modelling tool, a set of energy policies have been simulated."

Be that as it may, what have been found wanting are operational conditions for the achievement of environmental sustainability within specific anthropogenic systems, with cities being cited as a prime example of such systems. Indeed, from a historical perspective, cities have always been based on the concentration of humans and man-made elements, resulting in respective confinement of natural assets. As cities possess particular properties for their environmental basis, the general conditions governing sustainability require suitable modifications when applied to cities. In this context, the present paper examines the conditions for environmentally sustainable development in urban systems. The specific natural and socioeconomic characteristics of urban systems are systematically taken into account for defining environmentally sustainable development in cities. The paper proposes an operational framework for evaluating urban systems for their environmental performance. Urban systems, presenting specific characteristics necessary for creating welfare with high density, ask for particular conditions for their environmentally sustainable development. These conditions differ substantially from those defining sustainability in broader geographical systems. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment."

Despite widespread commitment to this goal, there is little consensus on what it means and how it should and could translate into practice. The paper shows that despite the emphasis on environmental justice and building sustainable communities in policy, the institutional context for implementation (including expert driven and deliberative approaches) do not always deliver on this mandate. Consequently, policy outcomes do not reflect those of the communities and households it is meant to serve, raising challenging moral and ethical questions for institutions involved in environmental governance. This paper shows how the institutional context of environmental assessment combined with the role played by the values held by environmental practitioners charged with influencing decision-making result in the perpetuation of environmental injustices. The lack of a clearly defined profession and professional body, reflecting a diversity of values, debating, regulating, defining and defending a set of principles to guide decision-making in cities is identified as a possible reason for the lack of congruence between the values reflected in policy with those held by the communities these interventions are intended to serve. The resulting value added by sustainable cities interventions in the light of this mismatch is therefore questionable, raising challenges regarding international calls for local action as well as an increasing policy focus in South Africa on the local level as the agent of political and spatial transformation of cities. © 2006."

No other city in Jordan has been planned on the basis of sustainability. Between 2000 and 2004, a special planning unit produced the current plan for achieving a sustainable city in Aqaba. The plan envisages investments of over US&amp;amp;dollar;6 billion and the creation of some 70,000 jobs by the year 2020. This article examines the work undertaken by the planners of sustainable Aqaba and appraises the outcome. A number of conclusions are presented about the need to encourage sustainability in the future planning of other areas as well as in the solution of many of Aqaba&amp;amp;apos;s problems.

As a result cities overspread such a big territory that the edges of the cities and location of provision centers are almost inconceivable. In this paper the method of game theory fitted for Geographic Information System (GIS) is given to evaluate and calculate the rate of city compactness. This methodology can help city planners to determine and localize problems of urban fabric density, to enhance motivation and versatility of decisions. For evaluation of city compactness efficiency attributes and the weights of it based on expert judgment are established. This model is applied to Kaunas city. On the basis of GIS the data bank of population, public transport stops and places of public attraction is prepared. Area of the city was divided by rectangular grid and analysis was made calculating efficiency attributes for each sector, applying Bayes rule. The results were visualized as diagrams showing most problematical areas. © 2006, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved."

Canadian cities, large and small, are facing challenges that are working against sustainability. For example, spatial segregation of poor residents is growing; the new economy wage structure is creating not only great wealth but also low-paid work; and new social policies are creating a poverty trap for the working poor. To meet these and other challenges, cities need to improve their problem-solving capacity by mobilizing talent across business, education, governments and civil society and by thinking in three dimensions: inclusively, regionally and from the bottom up. Many Canadian communities are now launched on this kind of problem solving, but they cannot succeed without responsive participation from senior governments."

Central to the issue of sustainability must therefore be the increasing domination of the city. Determining the sustainability of a city and the effect the city has on global sustainability must be considered from two perspectives that are largely analogous to Castells' bi-polar conflict between ""the Net"" and ""the Self"" [Castells, M., 1996. The Rise of the Network Society, vol. 1, first ed. Blackwell Publishers, Oxford, UK]. Cities must reconcile the conflict between being part of a competitive global city network and satisfying the day to day requirements of their own inhabitants. This dual perspective of cities and sustainability is examined in this paper with a view to determine an appropriate model for what may constitute a contemporary sustainable city.

It is inevitable, however, that certain problems exist during the construction of ecological city, which include but not limited to non-harmonious development of urban complex ecosystem, and the difficulty in quantifying eco-city construction or incomplete quantification in assessing the construction of present and future eco-city. Based on the analysis on social-economic conditions and regional conditions of the UAYD, this paper attempts to set up an index system of eco-cities combining with local characteristics, and to adopt the indices of eco-city, urban harmony, and eco-city colligate to evaluate the ecological level, urban harmonious development and eco-city construction of cities within the UAYD.

Some options listed, natural gas, hydrogen and electric vehicles, are most easily implemented by centrally refuelled fleets resulting in a natural synergy with the growing faction of commercial vehicles within cities. Life cycle costing of commercial vehicles enables the selection of clean technologies using financial benefits from fuel savings and maintenance.

The Eco-city Project will be used to showcase the latest green technologies adopted in buildings with a view to reducing the adverse effects of global warming, carbon emissions, and climate change; leading in the process to sustainable facilities. The purpose of this paper is to examine the institutional compliance framework for transferring environmental sustainability regulations from Singapore to China. Design/methodology/approach - The paper examines the current environmental sustainability regulations that are already in place in Singapore, with a view to possibly transfer these regulations as well as the supporting green technologies, codes and practices to the joint Sino-Singapore Eco-city Project in the PRC. The study proposes an understanding of the institutional compliance framework to facilitate this transfer. Findings - There are existing statutory provisions within the Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP) in the PRC that encourage the use of solar and renewable energy with a view to fostering sustainable construction, including provisions dealing with water pollution. However, beyond these generic areas, it appears that statutory provisions within the MEP do not institutionalize the same level of details that can be found in Singapore relating to the conceptualization, design and construction of sustainable facilities. Hence, transfer of such provisions from Singapore to the Tianjin Eco-city Project can be facilitated through an understanding of the institutional compliance framework from the Chinese side. Research limitations/implications - The environmental sustainability regulations that are already in place in Singapore will be examined in the paper. The study explains the reasons why these regulations were implemented in Singapore, and the framework within which such provisions may be transferred to the Tianjin Eco-city Project. Practical implications - The paper observes that while the legal systems in both Singapore and the PRC may be different, it would be strategic and expedient for the Chinese partners in the Eco-city joint project to familiarize themselves with the environmental sustainability regulations within Singapore's jurisdiction with a view to possibly adopting them in the PRC through the institutional compliance framework. Originality/value - Singapore is probably the first and only country in the world to enact building regulations pertaining to environmental sustainability with attendant inputs from an appropriate Code for Environmental Sustainability of Buildings and the Green Mark Scheme. The successful completion of the Tianjin Eco-city Project could provide a role model for further development of Eco-cities in the world, leading to greater emphasis to be placed on sustainable facilities anchored on the institutional compliance framework. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

Thus the cities themselves comprise the most critical infrastructure of the society. The resilience and robustness of the infrastructure of cities is thus essential to their sustainability. Since most of enterprises providing these services are privately or corporate owned and are highly competitive, their drive for economic efficiency also tends to make cities increasingly vulnerable to three kinds of disasters: technogenic, natural, and intentional. This paper explores the factors that govern the willingness or reluctance of private and corporate owners of critical services to invest in catastrophic risk reduction and the degree of public-private cooperation required to make cities more sustainable. Ultimately some changes in the political relationship between cities and states and the national governments that exercise sovereign authority over them will be required, as cities become the primary structure for the social and economic lives of people everywhere. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In this context, this paper offers an application of meta-analysis, as this approach is an interesting analytical contribution towards a better understanding of the critical success factors of urban energy policies. The paper starts with a general overview of the issue of urban sustainability and sets out the importance of energy policies at the urban level. It continues by offering a methodological framework for the assessment of critical factors related to the performance of sustainable energy strategies. Using a database containing information on experiences and expert expectations reegarding renewable energy initiatives in 12 European cities spread over 3 countries (Italy, the Netherlands and Greece), we offer a cross-European comparative analysis of the performance of urban renewable energy technologies.

The central question addressed in the paper is why some cities seem to take sustainability more seriously than others. Numerous demographic, socioeconomic and other characteristics of the cities are correlated with an Index of Taking Sustainability Seriously, which is a composite of some 34 different variables indicating whether each city engages in specific sustainability programmes, policies or activities. Many of the standard explanations, such as the income and wealth of the community, the liberalness of the city and the growth pressures placed on the city, are found to exhibit no correlation with the seriousness of the sustainability effort. What do correlate with the Index are: reliance on manufacturing, where having more residents employed in manufacturing industries is associated with less seriousness; and, the age of the population, where cities with older populations take sustainability more seriously. This has three implications for the future development of sustainable cities. First, some of the cities that might be said to need sustainability programmes the most-cities with heavy manufacturing that are more prone to pollution production-are the least likely to take such programmes seriously. Secondly, as cities' manufacturing bases decline, they should find it increasingly feasible to engage in sustainability initiatives. And, thirdly, as the populations of cities age, policy-makers should also find it easier to support, develop and take seriously sustainability programmes."

Energy-use measures combine all the characteristics of travel (mode, distance, and frequency), together with occupancy, to give a new set of composite measures of travel. The conclusions reached are mixed in that significant relationships have been found, principally between energy use in transport and physical characteristics of the city, such as density, size, and amount of open space.

The city's growth, environmental problems and administrative structures are explored within the context of sustainable urban development. Sustainable development is viewed as comprising economic, environ-mental and political concerns. It is argued that the city's path towards sustainability is greatly shaped by the country's development strategy and administrative structures. The development strategy is defined as urban biased and administrative structures, highly centralized with minimum involvement by nongovernmental organizations and community-based organizations in the decision making processes. The main conclusion drawn is that Botswana's efforts towards the realization of sustainable develoment - as contained in the country's National Conservation Strategy - have not yet been adequately incorporated into the country's urban planning practice."

This paper attempts to integrate two such particular areas of study, urban development and fresh water resources management. Following an overview of the concept of sustainable development, where the fresh water resource base is used to illustrate different interpretations of sustainability, the paper advances a number of perceptions of the sustainable city and the implications for fresh water management. Key concepts that emerge include a need to reduce the urban ecological sphere of influence, best understood in the context of a quasi-autonomous vision of the sustainable city, requiring a radical shift away from 'engineering-fix' water supply augmentation towards demand management and other approaches that sit more easily with the prime need to maintain the functional integrity of ecosystems."

The paper disputes the assumptions that telecommunications technologies are inherently environmentally benign; able to simply substitute for travel; can easily be manipulated to enhance urban environmental conditions. Instead research indicates that telecommunications directly raise serious environmental problems, they can help generate new demand for travel and that the technology cannot easily be exploited to achieve environmental objectives. © 1998 E. & EN Spon."

The notion of sustainable urban form has its roots in the Garden City movement at the turn of the century. The 'garden' cities of the 1900s and the 'ecological' cities of the 1970s were proposed as alternatives to the pathology of modern urban form. Just as cities provide a place for humans to live, so they destroy ecosystems and become unfit habitats for the human spirit. The city must be made more vital, humane, efficient, beautiful, self-sufficient, and natural through a return to a more compact form, its impact on the environment must be decreased. These themes have reemerged in the sustainable cities of the 1990s, advanced on behalf of future generations and planetary ecology. The sustainable city is a compact city. Calthorpe's 'Transit-Oriented Developments' (1989) are hailed as sustainable because their walkable streets free residents from reliance on automobiles and their high density preserves surrounding wildlife habitat. The European Commission (EC) rests a sustainable future for Europe (1990) on the twin pillars of urban compactness and urban regeneration. Nash (1991) believes that sustainable global urbanization would consist of 1.5 billion humans living in 500 compact cities. He calls his vision 'Island Civilisation'. The sustainable city is also a city of regenerative processes. Girardet (1990; 1992) thinks it has a 'circular metabolism' as distinguished from the 'linear metabolism' of contemporary cities. McDonough (adviser to President Clinton on 'sustainable development') theorizes in The Hannover Principles (1992) that in order to make civilization sustainable, urban form will have to be based on the principles of nature, which makes no waste, maximizes biodiversity and is sustained by the sun. The urban form designed by McDonald (1993), conceptualized with ideas from chaos theory, contemplates a sustainable city within a sustainable watershed and a form 'holistic' 'diverse' 'fractal' and 'evolutionary: Lyle (1994) believes that the sustainable cities of the next century will be based on the 'green infrastructure' of 'regenerative systems'. The commonality linking these landmarks of sustainable urbanization is the ideal of bringing the city into a vital symbiosis with nature. The sustainable city is a 'green' or 'living' city. The search for the sustainable city in the 20th century has not been Utopian but topian, a quest to create a form of city suited to optimal development of the Earth island."

The conference was held in the City of Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan, during November 2-4, 1995. Participants included representatives from 192 local authorities from 62 countries. Other participants included national/international governments and organizations, as well as nongovernmental organizations. The conference aimed to describe sustainable cities, to clarify problems faced by cities, and to develop local networks of cooperation. The Federal Minister of Regional Planning, Building, and Urban Development in Germany, presented the keynote address on ""Toward Sustainable Cities."" The Rector of the UN University spoke about the links between urbanization and sustainability in developing countries. Special sessions were devoted to industrial pollution, consumption patterns, the scale and nature of cities, energy, transportation, Local Agenda 21, and decision-making. Participants adopted the Kanagawa Declaration. The Declaration recognizes the role of local government in assuming responsibility for social welfare, environmental protection, and the threat to the global environment and human society from rapid population growth. Local authorities need to solve urban environmental problems. Sustainable cities are those that implement sustainable development. Local governments need to provide environmental information and education, form partnerships, seek international cooperation, and seek a strategy for securing sustainability on a global scale through research studies."

The ""text' is the manifesto, a proposal not just for cities, but for life  itself, stressing ecological sustainability and a localized political economy. The manifesto elaborates on the political, architectural and social forms that the sustainable city requires, drawing on historic notions of the corporation, the Italian hill town and dispersed power.

One outcome of this has been the implementation of the Resource Management Act 1991 (RMA). Fundamental to the RMA is sustainable management of natural resources at a regional scale. However, there are no prescriptive definitions for sustainable management in the act; rather the act allows regional and local government flexibility in developing policy and plans for economic development and environmental preservation. Recognizing the importance of biculturalism in New Zealand society, a further requirement of the Act grants Maori a significant role in the management of natural resources. Within this institutional context, Waitakere City, located on the western margin of the Auckland region, has adopted the principles of Agenda 21. The City Council has designated itself as an eco-city with a ""greenprint"" for future development and growth. A significant component of Agenda 21 is the explicit recognition of indigenous rights. Within its development plans, Waitakere City has adopted Maori concepts for resource management specifically for environmental preservation, water quality and sustainable management. This paper discusses the cross-cultural dynamics of natural resource management in Waitakere City. The first section describes the role of Agenda 21 and RMA in creating the eco-city and its relationship to the greater Auckland region. The second part examines the influence of biculturalism in implementing the goals of the eco-city.

The problem becomes even greater if we discuss cities. As recognised in many studies, a high percentage of the world population lives in cities, where quality of life and environmental concerns undermine all advantages associated with agglomeration economies. The vast experience in terms of theoretical and empirical substance which has been built up around the theme of 'sustainable economy' has only partially helped to generate a framework for an 'urban sustainable development'. The city is in fact by definition an 'artifact environment', where well-established concepts of 'environmental economics (such as natural capital stock, natural environment) can hardly be transferred and applied, in the way they are theoretically formulated. The first scope of the paper is to offer an analytical framework for 'urban sustainable development' to present the main economic concepts that are hidden under this label. In particular, different 'environments' co-exist in a city: the natural, the artifact and the social environment. Each of them generates positive and negative externalities for the city, since each of them represents 'use advantages' and 'use costs' for a city. If this is true, then it is a plausible assumption that the integration of these three 'environments' has to be supported with specific intervention policies. The main aim of this paper is to highlight the possible intervention policies which may be developed to achieve a balanced 'sustainable development' in terms of new policy principles that should govern the 'sustainable city'."

Energy consumption for hot water and space heating is limited to 60 per cent by techniques such as additional insulation, low-emission window glass, conservatories, heat recycling from ventilation air, and solar heating for both hot and water heating."
"Wastewater infrastructure: Challenges for the sustainable city in the new millennium","1996","10.1016/0197-3975(96)00022-7","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0030460274&doi=10.1016%2f0197-3975%2896%2900022-7&partnerID=40&md5=3ca4c0a36a414087f8ee3905f6d52203","Aspects of the technologies that might be employed in the wastewater infrastructures of cities in the longer-term future are discussed. For this purpose a wastewater infrastructure is defined as the string of unit process technologies used to recycle and return the water-borne residuals of a city to its surrounding environment. In the cities of Europe and North America, for example, this infrastructure conventionally comprises the urban sewer network, wastewater treatment plant, and receiving water body. To provide context and direction for the discussion, the impact of the city and its wastewater infrastructure on the surrounding environment is reviewed over a time-scale of centuries. Two analogies are employed in order to illustrate this impact: the concept of a city's 'metabolism' within the global cycling of materials; and the notion of gauging the 'health' of the system through something akin to measuring the 'pulse-rate' of an organism. Three scenarios are drawn for the possible pattern of adaptation and more radical change in the technological composition of the city's future wastewater infrastructure. These may culminate in a structure altogether different from that with which we are familiar today, i.e. a decentralised, highly segregated system in which control and manipulation of the composition of any residual at its source is maximised. Further, it is argued that the issue of reliability of performance may be a critical (technological) factor in choosing a preferred form of wastewater infrastructure. We do not discuss the economic, social or cultural dimensions of our subject; we acknowledge that these are likely to be decisive considerations, the seeming technological attraction of any option notwithstanding.

Instead, planners work within the tension generated among these three fundamental aims, which, collectively, I call the “planner's triangle,” with sustainable development located at its center. This center cannot be reached directly, but only approximately and indirectly, through a sustained period of confronting and resolving the triangle's conflicts. To do so, planners have to redefine sustainability, since its current formulation romanticizes our sustainable past and is too vaguely holistic. Planners would benefit both from integrating social theory with environmental thinking and from combining their substantive skills with techniques for community conflict resolution, to confront economic and environmental injustice. © 1996 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

As we become more aware of the pollution risks from sewage and industry, there is a tendency to abandon use of this resource, allowing groundwater levels to rise and causing geotechnical problems. Although these hazards are genuine, good management can reduce the risks, either by using the water for industrial purposes, or by precautionary monitoring and treatment. Making full use of urban groundwater is surely a sound part in development of the sustainable city."

Accomplished by Jaime Lerner, former mayor of Curitiba, this city has been called by some planners the most environmentally advanced urban area on Earth. Several initiatives have contributed to Curitiba's environmental success. Most important of these initiatives is the bus system, which offers faster, cheaper and more comfortable transportation. Created in the 1970s, the system is a winning mix of fast express arteries, local feeder buses, and special routes for circulating in the downtown area. From this bus system a series of other initiatives were facilitated, including the creation of a 42 sq. km ""Industrial City"". This Industrial City is restricted to low-polluting industries, which generates about 33,000 jobs directly and another 150,000 indirectly. Moreover, Curitiba launched a series of programs aimed not only at preserving the city's existing trees and green space, but adding to them. Other programs include trading garbage for food, recycling rates, and free health care."

This article charts the development of this debate, in particular examining the controversial decision to locate the MFP in what its critics regard as a polluted swamp in the north of Adelaide. This paper outlines the concept of the MFP, looks at the environmental issues which the MFP raises for creating sustainable urban development, and seeks to identify some of the challenges to urban planning and urban governance raised by the MFP. In this respect, some interesting tensions have arisen between the different strands of the MFP debate, where commercial viability and political credibility have become a central issue for investors, whilst environmental issues have emerged as a pivotal theme in gaining community acceptance of the MFP proposal. -from Author"

Specialist contributors confront a set of disparate issues. The attempt to apply Earth Summit principles to urban management in New Zealand is examined; political coalitions to combat urban development that is impacting upon Los Angeles are discussed; a comprehensive review of the problems of air pollution facing the residents of Mexico City is provided, and the possibilities for the generation of sustainable cities in the Pacific Northwest are examined. Three key points arise: the social cost of economic development, the geographical disparity in the distribution of positive and negative externalities, and the need to develop political strategies that can generate policy initiative that will embrace the urban environment that integrates social, political, economic and natural phenomena, rather than seeing them as competing elements in a cost-benefit analysis."

The article argues the need for specific initiatives which reflect local level needs within a strategic initiative for the whole urban hierarchy. Using the social city region as its starting point, the article highlights the inadequacy of the compact city concept in light of continued population decentralisation. The social city region provides a framework for complementary, area specific policies for sustainability. The article concludes with an illustration of the policy objectives of two particular types of areas, the social city region, and the mixed urban-rural area. -S.Tanner"

When national governments have established regional marine resources management programmes, e.g. the Baltic, the Mediterranean, or the Great Lakes region, the final remediation planning responsibility has ultimately been delegated to local authorities. The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development held in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992 did not consider this dichotomy and the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI) and a coalition of other local government associations are considered to have a role within the two sectors, national governments and non-governmental organizations. Chapter 17 of Agenda 21 on Protection of the Oceans gives little attention to the primary role presently being played by the local authorities in controlling marine pollution. Chapter 17 states that 70% of the marine pollution comes from land-based sources, and that more than half of the world's population is settled in coastal communities. But the Chapter does not present the fact that local authorities are the primary force in organizing and managing the coastal settlements concerning the greatest sources of marine pollution. The role of local authorities in Agenda 21 and the partnership between the international community and local authorities to achieve Agenda 21 objectives must be defined. © 1994."

In light of that nation's transition to a non-racial democracy, the particular task of the paper is to review the potential and policy implications of urban agriculture in the context of national initiatives for post-apartheid reconstruction. To reach these objectives, findings of household surveys are presented on the nature, methods and problems of production of groups of urban and peri-urban farmers. Income surveys supplemented by participatory techniques are used to gather further information on the problems faced. These major problems include gaining access to land with secure title for cultivation, finance, machinery, transport, crop security and the need for support services. The policy implications which emerge are then discussed. © 1995."
